"""
Vectorized segment deduplication for WhisperX transcription output.

When alignment is disabled (ENABLE_ALIGNMENT=false), WhisperX returns both
coarse VAD-chunked segments AND their fine-grained sentence subsegments,
creating overlapping/duplicate entries. This module merges them using numpy
interval operations - no ML model needed.

The dominant pattern is "full containment": a long segment (e.g., 0.0-40.0s)
followed by shorter subsegments of the same content (0.0-13.0s, 14.0-25.0s, etc).
The fix: detect containment groups, keep the fine-grained segments, discard coarse.

    Remove duplicate/overlapping segments from WhisperX output.

    Uses vectorized numpy operations for O(n log n) performance.
