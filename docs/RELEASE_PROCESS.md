## Troubleshooting

### Forgot to Bump Version Before Tagging

```bash
# Delete tag locally and remotely
git tag -d vX.Y.Z
git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z

# Make version changes
# ... edit files ...

# Commit version bump
git add VERSION pyproject.toml frontend/package.json frontend/package-lock.json
git commit -m "chore: Bump version to X.Y.Z"

# Recreate and push tag
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "message"
git push origin master
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

### Need to Update Release Notes

```bash
# Edit existing release
gh release edit vX.Y.Z --notes "updated notes"

# Or delete and recreate
gh release delete vX.Y.Z --yes
gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "title" --notes "notes"
```

### Branch Won't Delete (Not Fully Merged)

After squash merge, the branch appears "not fully merged":
```bash
# Force delete is safe after squash merge
git branch -D branch-name
```

### Tag Already Exists Error

```bash
# Delete existing tag
git tag -d vX.Y.Z
git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z

# Recreate
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "message"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

### Writing Guidelines

1. **Be User-Focused**: Write from the user's perspective, not developer's
   - ❌ "Refactored authentication module"
   - ✅ "Login is now 2x faster"

2. **Be Specific**: Avoid vague descriptions
   - ❌ "Various bug fixes"
   - ✅ "Fixed crash when uploading files larger than 2GB"

3. **Use Action Verbs**: Start items with verbs
   - Added, Fixed, Improved, Updated, Removed, Deprecated

4. **Include Context**: Explain why changes matter
   - ❌ "Updated nginx to 1.29.4"
   - ✅ "Updated nginx to 1.29.4 (fixes 3 security vulnerabilities)"

5. **Link to Issues/PRs**: Reference related issues
   - "Fixed pagination for large transcripts (#110)"

6. **Group Related Changes**: Don't scatter related items

7. **Highlight Breaking Changes**: Make them impossible to miss

8. **Include Upgrade Instructions**: Every release needs clear update steps

### When to Increment

| Change Type | Version Part | Example |

| New feature | MINOR | 0.2.0 → 0.3.0 |
| Bug fix | PATCH | 0.2.0 → 0.2.1 |
| Security fix | PATCH | 0.2.0 → 0.2.1 |
| Performance improvement | MINOR or PATCH | Depends on scope |
| Documentation only | No version change | - |
