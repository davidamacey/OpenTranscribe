INSTALLATION PROCESS:

When you click Next, the installer will:

1. VERIFY PREREQUISITES (automatic, ~30 seconds)
   - Check Docker Desktop is running
   - Verify WSL 2 configuration
   - Confirm sufficient RAM, CPU, disk space
   - Detect GPU availability (optional)

   ⚠ Installation will STOP if prerequisites are not met
   ⚠ You will receive detailed instructions to fix any issues

2. INSTALL APPLICATION (if prerequisites pass)
   - Load Docker container images (~10-30GB)
   - Install AI models (~5-40GB depending on model size)
   - Configure environment variables and networking
   - Start OpenTranscribe services
   - Create desktop shortcuts

Total installation time: 5-15 minutes (after prerequisites pass)

IMPORTANT NOTES:

- Close any running applications to free up system resources
- Ensure your system is plugged into power (laptops)
- Disable antivirus temporarily if installation fails
- First run will take longer as Docker initializes containers

IF INSTALLATION IS BLOCKED:

The installer will tell you exactly what's wrong. Common fixes:
- Start Docker Desktop and wait for it to fully initialize
- Free up disk space (need 100GB+ free)
- Install/enable WSL 2: wsl --install
- Update Windows to build 17763 or later

You can also run check-prerequisites.ps1 manually for detailed diagnostics.
