## Growing Community

In just over a month since our v0.1.0 release, OpenTranscribe has seen exciting growth:

- **8 GitHub Stars** - Thank you for the support!
- **7 Pull Requests** from community contributor [@SQLServerIO](https://github.com/SQLServerIO) (Wes Brown)
- **Critical feature request** from [@LaboratorioInternacionalWeb](https://github.com/LaboratorioInternacionalWeb) that shaped this release

This release proves that open source works. Real users finding real issues, submitting real fixes, and making the software better for everyone.

## Community Contributions

### Wes Brown's Seven Pull Requests

A massive thank you to **Wes Brown** ([@SQLServerIO](https://github.com/SQLServerIO)) who submitted an incredible seven pull requests addressing real-world issues he encountered while using OpenTranscribe:

1. **[PR #110](https://github.com/davidamacey/OpenTranscribe/pull/110)**: Pagination for large transcripts - Fixes page hanging with thousands of segments
2. **[PR #107](https://github.com/davidamacey/OpenTranscribe/pull/107)**: Auto-cleanup garbage transcription segments
3. **[PR #106](https://github.com/davidamacey/OpenTranscribe/pull/106)**: User admin endpoints now use UUID instead of integer ID
4. **[PR #105](https://github.com/davidamacey/OpenTranscribe/pull/105)**: Speaker merge UI and segment speaker reassignment
5. **[PR #104](https://github.com/davidamacey/OpenTranscribe/pull/104)**: LLM model discovery for OpenAI-compatible providers
6. **[PR #103](https://github.com/davidamacey/OpenTranscribe/pull/103)**: Per-file speaker count settings in upload and reprocess UI
7. **[PR #102](https://github.com/davidamacey/OpenTranscribe/pull/102)**: PyTorch 2.6+ compatibility and speaker diarization settings

These contributions came from someone actively using OpenTranscribe in their workflow, identifying pain points, and taking the time to fix them. This is exactly what open source is all about.

### The Multilingual Feature Request

Issue [#99](https://github.com/davidamacey/OpenTranscribe/issues/99) from [@LaboratorioInternacionalWeb](https://github.com/LaboratorioInternacionalWeb) highlighted a critical gap in our product: Spanish audio files were being transcribed to English because WhisperX was hardcoded with `language="en"` and `task="translate"`.

This wasn't just a bug report - it was a feature request that opened our eyes to the importance of serving a global community. OpenTranscribe should work for everyone, regardless of what language they speak.

## What's New in v0.2.0

### Multilingual Transcription Support (100+ Languages)

The headline feature of this release is comprehensive multilingual support:

**User-Configurable Language Settings:**
- **Source Language**: Auto-detect or specify the audio language (100+ languages supported)
- **Translate to English**: Toggle to translate non-English audio (default: OFF - keeps original language)
- **LLM Output Language**: Generate AI summaries in 12 different languages

**Technical Details:**
- ~42 languages have word-level timestamp support via wav2vec2 alignment
- Languages without alignment gracefully fall back to segment-level timestamps
- Settings are stored per-user in the database

### UI Internationalization (7 Languages)

In response to the multilingual feature request, I thought: "If we're supporting 100+ transcription languages, why not make the UI multilingual too?"

What I expected to be a quick weekend project turned into **5 days of after-work sessions with Claude** (the AI assistant) to find, update, and create translations across the entire frontend.

The UI is now available in:
- English (default)
- Spanish (Espa\u00f1ol)
- French (Fran\u00e7ais)
- German (Deutsch)
- Portuguese (Portugu\u00eas)
- Chinese (\u4e2d\u6587)
- Japanese (\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e)

This opens OpenTranscribe to a much wider global community, and we welcome contributions for additional languages!

### Speaker Management Enhancements

- **Speaker Merge UI**: New visual interface to combine duplicate speakers with segment preview and reassignment
- **Per-File Speaker Settings**: Configure min/max speakers at upload or reprocess time
- **User-Level Preferences**: Save default speaker detection settings (always prompt, use defaults, use custom values)

### LLM Integration Improvements

- **Model Auto-Discovery**: Automatic detection of available models for vLLM, Ollama, and Anthropic providers
- **Anthropic Support Enhanced**: Native model discovery via /v1/models API, default model updated to Claude Opus 4.5
- **Multilingual Output**: Generate AI summaries in 12 different languages
- **Improved Configuration UX**: Toast notifications, better API key handling, edit mode with stored keys
- **Updated Default Models**: Anthropic uses claude-opus-4-5-20251101, Ollama uses llama3.2:latest

### Performance & Stability

- **Pagination for Large Transcripts**: No more browser hanging with thousands of segments
- **Auto-Cleanup Garbage Segments**: Automatic detection and removal of erroneous transcription segments
- **PyTorch 2.6+ Compatibility**: Support for the latest PyTorch versions
- **Backend Code Quality**: Reduced cyclomatic complexity across 47 functions in 27 files

### Admin & User Experience

- **System Statistics**: CPU, memory, disk, and GPU usage now visible to all users
- **Admin Password Reset**: Secure password reset functionality with validation
- **UUID Consistency**: Fixed admin endpoints to use UUID instead of integer IDs

## The Value of Community Feedback

This release demonstrates something important: **real users make software better**.

Every one of Wes Brown's pull requests addressed an actual pain point he encountered while using OpenTranscribe. The multilingual request from LaboratorioInternacionalWeb pushed us to think beyond the English-speaking world.

These aren't hypothetical improvements or features we thought might be useful someday. These are fixes and enhancements that make a real difference for real people doing real work.

## On Building Internationalization

A note on the i18n (internationalization) implementation: I thought it would be straightforward. "Just wrap strings in a translation function and create some JSON files, right?"

Four days later, after working through evenings with Claude to identify every user-facing string across dozens of components, create translation files for 7 languages, handle pluralization, and ensure consistent terminology... I have a new appreciation for the teams that build truly international software.

The lesson: internationalization is best done from the start. Retrofitting it is possible but requires patience. Thank you to Claude for the assistance in this marathon effort.

## Upgrading to v0.2.0

```bash
# If using the production installer
cd opentranscribe
./opentranscribe.sh update

# Or pull the latest Docker images
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Database migrations run automatically on startup - no manual intervention required.

## What's Next

As we continue toward v1.0.0, we're focused on:

- Real-time/live transcription support
- Enhanced search capabilities
- Improved speaker diarization accuracy
- RAG-based chat with transcript content
- More language translations for the UI
