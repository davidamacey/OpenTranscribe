# Search Architecture

This document explains how OpenTranscribe's search system works, including how results are ranked, what signals contribute to relevance, and the technical architecture behind it.

## Overview

OpenTranscribe uses **hybrid search** — a combination of keyword matching and semantic (meaning-based) similarity — powered by OpenSearch. When you search, two independent methods run simultaneously, and their results are merged into a single ranked list.

## v0.4.0 Search Fixes

### Hybrid Search Was Non-Functional in v0.3.x

A critical bug in OpenSearch 3.4 caused an internal `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` whenever a `hybrid` query was combined with all three of: `aggs` (cardinality aggregation), `collapse`, and an RRF `search_pipeline`. The exception was silently swallowed — searches returned BM25-only results with no error to the user. Semantic search was completely non-functional.

The fix (v0.4.0) removes `aggs` from the hybrid query body. Total file count is now derived from the collapsed result set. BM25-only fallback retains `aggs` (no crash on that path).

**Before the fix**: A search for `"pytorch"` returned 1 result. After: 83 results (semantic matches recovered).

### Cosine Similarity Scores Were Systematically Inflated

OpenSearch's `cosinesimil` kNN space type returns `(1 + cosine) / 2`, not raw cosine. A speaker with a true cosine similarity of 0.50 to a stored profile was being reported as 0.75. All speaker matching and profile matching thresholds were effectively applied at wrong values.

Fixed at 8 locations in the codebase. The conversion `raw_cosine = 2.0 * score - 1.0` is now applied at every kNN score read site.

## How Search Results Are Ranked

### Two Search Methods

**1. Keyword Search (BM25)**

Traditional full-text search that looks for word matches. It scores based on:
- **Term frequency** — how often the search term appears in a segment
- **Inverse document frequency** — rarer words score higher (matching "diarization" is worth more than matching "the")
- **Field length normalization** — a match in a short title scores higher than the same match buried in a long transcript

In v0.4.0 the BM25 leg uses `fuzziness: AUTO` (typo tolerance), `type: cross_fields` (terms can span multiple fields), and phrase slop for near-phrase matching.

**2. Semantic Search (Neural/Vector)**

Meaning-based search using a sentence-transformer model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2` by default, 384 dimensions). In v0.4.0, embedding generation is handled entirely **server-side** by OpenSearch ML Commons — neither the backend nor the client generates embeddings. The model is registered and deployed within the OpenSearch 3.4.0 cluster. Queries are sent as text; OpenSearch generates the vector internally.

For example, searching "compensation discussion" can match a segment about "salary negotiations" even though those exact words don't appear.

### Combining Results: Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)

The two search methods each produce their own ranked list. These are combined using **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**, a technique that merges rankings without needing to normalize different scoring systems.

The formula for each document:

```
RRF_score = 1/(k + rank_in_keyword) + 1/(k + rank_in_semantic)
```

Where `k` is a constant (default: 30 in v0.4.0, configurable via `SEARCH_RRF_RANK_CONSTANT`) that controls how much weight goes to top-ranked results.

**What this means in practice:**
- A file ranked #1 in keyword search and #5 in semantic search scores higher than one ranked #3 in both
- Documents that appear in both lists get a natural boost
- Neither method can completely dominate the other

### Why More Keyword Matches Doesn't Always Mean Higher Rank

Several factors explain why a file with fewer keyword matches might rank higher:

1. **RRF uses rank position, not match count** — What matters is how highly the best-matching segment ranked, not how many segments matched
2. **Best segment wins** — A file's rank is determined by its single highest-scoring segment, not the total number of matches
3. **Semantic signal matters** — Strong meaning-based similarity contributes to the combined score even with fewer keyword hits
4. **Field boosting** — A match in the transcript content (3x boost) or speaker name (3x boost) outweighs matches in lower-weighted fields
5. **Dual-match bonus** — Files with both keyword AND semantic matches get a +5% relevance display bonus

### Field Boosting

Not all fields are weighted equally. When searching:

| Field | Boost | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Transcript content | 3x | The actual spoken words (stemmed for English) |
| Transcript content (exact) | 2x | Exact phrase matching without stemming |
| File title | 2x | The filename or title |
| Speaker name | 3x | Speaker names (excluded when filtering by speaker) |

## How Transcripts Are Indexed

### Chunking Strategy

Transcripts are broken into searchable chunks using a speaker-turn-based strategy:

1. **Group by speaker turn** — Consecutive segments from the same speaker are merged into a single turn
2. **Split long turns at sentence boundaries** — Turns exceeding ~200 words are split using NLTK punkt sentence tokenizer (supports 18 languages) with sentence-level overlap between chunks to preserve context. Falls back to word-count splitting for single-sentence turns or when NLTK is unavailable
3. **Sentence-aligned overlap** — Instead of raw word-count overlap, trailing sentences from the previous chunk are carried forward as overlap. The overlap target is ~40 words, selecting whole sentences that fit within that budget
4. **Merge short turns** — Very short turns (< 20 words) from the same speaker are merged with the previous chunk
5. **Word-level timestamp boundaries** — When word-level timestamps are available (from faster-whisper), chunk start/end times are computed from actual word boundaries rather than linear interpolation. This provides accurate jump-to-position for search results
6. **One chunk = one OpenSearch document** — Each chunk is indexed separately with the file's metadata

**Typical results:**
- 30-minute meeting: ~10-15 chunks
- Long monologue/lecture: ~15-50 chunks
- Short conversational exchanges: ~5-10 chunks

### What's Stored Per Chunk

Each chunk contains:
- **Content** — The transcript text for that segment
- **Speaker** — The primary speaker of the chunk
- **Timestamps** — Start and end times for video navigation
- **File metadata** — Title, all speakers, tags, upload time, language
- **Vector embedding** — 384-dimensional semantic representation (when neural search is enabled)

## Search Result Display

### Relevance Percentage

The percentage shown on search results is a **normalized display score** mapped to a 20-99% range:

- **99%** — The most relevant result in this particular search
- **20%** — The least relevant result that passed filtering
- **+5% bonus** — Applied to files that matched on both keyword and semantic signals

This percentage is relative to the current search — it's not an absolute quality score.

### Match Types

Results are classified by how they matched:

- **Keyword match** — Exact word matches found (highlighted in results)
- **Semantic match** — Meaning-based similarity found (related terms highlighted)
- **Both** — Matched on both signals (highest confidence)

### Semantic-Only Filtering

Results that match only on semantic similarity (no keyword overlap) face additional filtering to prevent low-confidence matches from appearing:

- Must exceed a minimum score threshold
- The weakest 35% of semantic-only results are suppressed
- Remaining semantic-only results are labeled with confidence level (high/low)

## Configuration

These settings can be tuned via environment variables:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SEARCH_RRF_RANK_CONSTANT` | 30 | RRF weighting constant. Lower values give more weight to top-ranked results |
| `SEARCH_RRF_WINDOW_SIZE` | 500 | Number of results each search method retrieves before RRF combination |
| `SEARCH_MAX_OVERFETCH` | 1000 | Maximum documents retrieved per leg before RRF collapse (raised from 200 in v0.4.0) |
| `SEARCH_CHUNK_TARGET_WORDS` | 200 | Target word count per transcript chunk |
| `SEARCH_CHUNK_OVERLAP_WORDS` | 40 | Word overlap between split chunks for context preservation |
| `SEARCH_HYBRID_MIN_SCORE` | 0.01 | Minimum score threshold for semantic-only results |
| `SEARCH_SEMANTIC_SUPPRESS_RATIO` | 0.35 | Ratio of weakest semantic-only results to suppress |
| `SEARCH_COLLAPSE_MAX_CONCURRENT` | 20 | Max concurrent group searches for collapse inner_hits |
| `OPENSEARCH_NEURAL_SEARCH_ENABLED` | true | Enable/disable semantic search (falls back to keyword-only) |
| `OPENSEARCH_NEURAL_MODEL` | `huggingface/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | Embedding model for semantic search |

### Available Embedding Models

| Tier | Model | Dimensions | Size | Language |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fast (default) | all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | 384 | 80MB | English |
| Fast | paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2 | 384 | 420MB | 50+ languages |
| Balanced | all-mpnet-base-v2 | 768 | 420MB | English |
| Balanced | paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2 | 768 | 1.1GB | 50+ languages |
| Best quality | all-distilroberta-v1 | 768 | 290MB | English |
| Best multilingual | distiluse-base-multilingual-cased-v1 | 512 | 480MB | 15 languages |

Changing models requires reindexing all transcripts. Use the admin reindex function after changing the model.

### Index Structure

- **Index name**: `transcript_chunks` (aliased as `transcript_search`)
- **One document per chunk** with denormalized file metadata
- **Custom `transcript` analyzer**: English snowball stemmer, stop words, and shingle filter (bigram/trigram) for the `content` field
- **Index sorting by `file_uuid` + `chunk_index`** for optimized collapse grouping
- **`eager_global_ordinals`** on `speaker` and `tags` fields for faster filter aggregations
- **HNSW vector index**: Cosine similarity, ef_construction=256, m=16 for the embedding field

### Word-Level Timestamp Storage

Transcript segments can optionally store word-level timestamps from faster-whisper as a JSONB column (`words`) on the `TranscriptSegment` model. Each entry contains:

```json
[{"word": "hello", "start": 0.1, "end": 0.25, "score": 0.95}, ...]
```

**How it improves search:**
- When chunking a long speaker turn, chunk boundaries are computed from actual word timestamps instead of uniform interpolation (`time_per_word = duration / word_count`)
- This eliminates 5-15 second timestamp errors common in long monologue segments where speech pace varies
- Search results link to precise positions in the audio/video

**Backwards compatibility:**
- The `words` column is nullable — existing segments without word data continue to work
- Chunking falls back to linear interpolation when `words` is NULL
- No re-transcription is required for existing files (word timestamps are populated on new transcriptions)
