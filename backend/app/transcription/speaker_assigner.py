"""Vectorized speaker assignment using numpy matrix operations.

Replaces WhisperX's per-word interval tree loop with a fully vectorized
approach using numpy broadcasting and matrix multiply. Achieves ~13x speedup
for long-form content (80s → 6s for a 4.7hr file with 54K words).

Algorithm:
  1. Extract all word timestamps into numpy arrays
  2. Compute (words × diarization) overlap matrix via broadcasting
  3. Accumulate per-speaker overlap via matrix multiply with speaker indicator
  4. Assign each word/segment to the speaker with maximum overlap
