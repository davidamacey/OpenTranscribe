# Quick Start Guide

Get OpenTranscribe up and running in less than 5 minutes with our one-line installer.

## One-Line Installation

Run this single command on any platform (Linux, macOS, Windows WSL2):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidamacey/OpenTranscribe/master/setup-opentranscribe.sh | bash
```

The installer will:
✅ Detect your hardware automatically (NVIDIA GPU, Apple Silicon, CPU)
✅ Configure optimal settings for your platform
✅ Download Docker images from Docker Hub
✅ Generate secure configuration
✅ Set up management scripts

## Prerequisites

Before running the installer, ensure you have:

1. **Docker & Docker Compose** installed and running
2. **Internet connection** for downloading images and models
3. **8GB+ RAM** (16GB+ recommended)

:::info HuggingFace Token Required
For speaker diarization to work, you'll need a **free HuggingFace token**. The installer will prompt you for it. See [HuggingFace Setup](../installation/huggingface-setup.md) for details.

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Run the Installer

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidamacey/OpenTranscribe/master/setup-opentranscribe.sh | bash

The installer will ask for:

1. **HuggingFace Token** (optional but recommended)
   - Used for speaker diarization models
   - Get a free token at [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)

2. **Whisper Model Size** (default: auto-detected based on hardware)
   - `large-v2` - Best accuracy (NVIDIA GPU recommended)
   - `medium` - Good balance (8GB+ GPU or Apple Silicon)
   - `base` - Fast (CPU-only systems)
