# Transcription Pipeline Optimization

## Architecture Overview

OpenTranscribe uses a custom transcription pipeline (`backend/app/transcription/`) that bypasses WhisperX for the default path, using faster-whisper's `BatchedInferencePipeline` with native word timestamps + PyAnnote v4 diarization directly.

**Two engines available** (controlled by `TRANSCRIPTION_ENGINE` env var):

| Engine | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `native` | Yes | faster-whisper BatchedInferencePipeline + PyAnnote v4 direct |
| `whisperx` | Fallback | Legacy WhisperX pipeline with optional wav2vec2 alignment |

### Native Pipeline Flow

```
Audio Load (decode_audio)
  -> Transcribe (BatchedInferencePipeline, word_timestamps=True, vad_filter=True)
  -> Release transcriber VRAM
  -> Diarize (PyAnnote v4 direct)
  -> Speaker Assignment (interval tree + NumPy, 273x faster than WhisperX)
  -> Segment Dedup (vectorized numpy, <0.2s)
  -> Result
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **BatchedInferencePipeline + word_timestamps=True**: WhisperX hardcodes `word_timestamps=False` in its batched pipeline. We bypass it and call faster-whisper directly, getting batched speed WITH word-level timestamps. This eliminates the need for wav2vec2 alignment entirely.

2. **Sequential VRAM mode**: Transcriber is loaded, used, and released before the diarizer loads. This keeps peak VRAM low (~5-9GB) for compatibility with 8-12GB GPUs.

3. **Warm model caching (ModelManager)**: Models persist between Celery tasks via a singleton. For batch imports of 2500 files, this saves ~10 hours of model loading overhead.

4. **PyAnnote v4 direct**: No monkey-patching via `pyannote_compat.py`. The native engine calls PyAnnote v4's API directly, handling the v4 output format (exclusive_speaker_diarization, overlap detection) natively.

5. **Silero VAD built-in**: faster-whisper's `vad_filter=True` uses Silero VAD internally. No separate VAD step needed.

### Package Structure

### Pipeline Comparison

| Configuration | Total | Transcription | Alignment | Diarization | Speaker Assign | Dedup |
|---------------|-------|---------------|-----------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Old baseline (WhisperX + alignment ON) | **706s** | 75s | 389s | 194s | 10.2s | N/A |
| WhisperX batched, alignment OFF + dedup | **304s** | 76s | SKIPPED | 198s | 0.04s | <0.1s |
| Native word_ts, beam=1, int8, sequential | **437s** | 173s | N/A | 192s | 0.5s | 0.1s |
| **Native pipeline (batch_size=32, beam=5)** | **332s** | 105s | N/A | 192s | 0.5s | 0.1s |

### Quality Comparison

| Metric | WhisperX no-align + dedup | Native pipeline | Threshold |
|--------|--------------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Text word overlap | 92.5% | ~92% | >85% |
| Speaker consistency | 76.7% (segment-level) | 95.2% (word-level) | >75% |
| Timestamp MAE | 0.00s start | 0.00s start | <5.0s |

**Key insight**: Native word timestamps give 95% speaker consistency (vs 77% without alignment) because word-level timestamps enable precise speaker-to-word matching via the interval tree algorithm.

### VRAM Usage

| Step | VRAM (observed) | Notes |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| Transcription (large-v3-turbo) | ~3-4 GB | BatchedInferencePipeline |
| Diarization (PyAnnote v4) | ~5-9 GB | Peak depends on audio length |
| Speaker embeddings | ~4.5-6.6 GB | Post-pipeline, separate step |
| **Peak (sequential mode)** | **~9 GB** | Transcriber released before diarizer |

### Scaling Projections (2500 Three-Hour Files)

| Configuration | Per File | 2500 Files | With 4x GPU Workers |
|---------------|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Old baseline (WhisperX + alignment) | 706s | 490 hours | 123 hours |
| **Native pipeline** | **332s** | **231 hours** | **58 hours** |
| + warm model caching (batch import) | ~320s | 222 hours | 56 hours |
| + 4x GPU workers on A6000 | ~80s eff | 56 hours | N/A |

#### WhisperX-only Variables (when TRANSCRIPTION_ENGINE=whisperx)

| Variable | Default | Description |

### Recommended Configurations

**Maximum Speed (batch processing)**:
```env
TRANSCRIPTION_ENGINE=native
WHISPER_MODEL=large-v3-turbo
# beam_size and compute_type auto-optimized by hardware detection
```

**Maximum Quality**:
```env
TRANSCRIPTION_ENGINE=whisperx
WHISPER_MODEL=large-v3
ENABLE_ALIGNMENT=true
```

**Low VRAM (8GB GPU)**:
```env
TRANSCRIPTION_ENGINE=native
WHISPER_MODEL=large-v3-turbo
# batch_size auto-detected to 8 for 8GB GPUs
# Sequential mode keeps peak VRAM under 9GB
```

### Whisper Model Selection

| Model | Speed | VRAM | English | Multilingual | Translation |
|-------|-------|------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| `large-v3-turbo` | 6x faster | ~6GB | Excellent | Good | **NO** |

**Warning**: `large-v3-turbo` cannot translate. If "Translate to English" is needed, use `large-v3`.

## Optimization History & Key Findings

### Why We Built the Native Pipeline

WhisperX was the original transcription backend but had architectural constraints:

1. **Alignment bottleneck**: wav2vec2 alignment took 389s (55% of total) for a 3hr file. It processes segments sequentially — 300+ separate CUDA kernel launches instead of batched.

2. **No batched word timestamps**: WhisperX deliberately hardcodes `word_timestamps=False` in its batched pipeline (`asr.py` lines 370-372). You had to choose: batched speed OR word timestamps.

3. **Monkey-patching required**: PyAnnote v4 API changes required a 465-line compatibility layer (`pyannote_compat.py`) that monkey-patched WhisperX's diarization internals.

### What We Tried (Chronological)

| Approach | Result | Outcome |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Disable alignment + segment dedup | 316s, 99.5% quality match | Good speed, but only 77% speaker consistency (segment-level timestamps) |
| Parallel alignment + diarization | 579s, GPU contention 16-24% | Not worth it on same GPU |
| Batched wav2vec2 alignment | ~420s estimated | Implemented but still slow |
| Native word_timestamps (sequential) | 437s, 95% speaker consistency | Good quality but slower than batched |
| **BatchedInferencePipeline + word_timestamps** | **332s, 95% speaker consistency** | **Best of both worlds** |

The breakthrough was discovering that faster-whisper 1.2.1's `BatchedInferencePipeline.transcribe()` supports `word_timestamps=True` — batched speed with word-level timestamps. WhisperX didn't expose this.

### Segment Dedup: Why It's Needed

Without wav2vec2 alignment, WhisperX outputs both coarse VAD-chunked segments AND fine-grained subsegments for the same time ranges. The native pipeline also produces overlapping segments from VAD chunking.

The dedup module (`backend/app/utils/segment_dedup.py`) handles this:
1. NLTK punkt sentence splitting (replicates what alignment implicitly provided)
2. Containment detection — removes coarse "parent" segments covered by finer children
3. Exact text duplicate removal
4. Time+text overlap merging

Performance: <0.2s for 3000+ segments (vectorized numpy). Quality: 99.5% match to aligned baseline.

### Fast Speaker Assignment: 273x Speedup

The original WhisperX `assign_word_speakers()` used O(n) linear scan per word. Our replacement (`backend/app/utils/fast_speaker_assignment.py`) uses an interval tree + NumPy vectorization for O(log n) per query.

- WhisperX: 10.2s for 150 segments, 1349 words
- Ours: 0.037s (273x faster)

### Warm Model Caching

The `ModelManager` singleton (`backend/app/transcription/model_manager.py`) keeps models loaded between Celery tasks. Since the GPU worker has concurrency=1, only one task runs at a time — safe for singleton model state.

| Scenario | Model Loading Overhead |
|----------|----------------------|
| Without cache (per-file load/unload) | 2500 files x 15s = 10.4 hours |
| With warm cache (first file only) | 15s + 2500 x ~0s = 15 seconds |

## PyAnnote Diarization Notes

- **Non-deterministic**: PyAnnote uses neural embeddings + agglomerative clustering. Small floating-point variations between runs can shift speaker boundaries, especially at edges.
- **No hard speaker limit**: `AgglomerativeClustering` has no maximum — `MAX_SPEAKERS=50+` works for large events.
- **VRAM scales with audio length**: ~5GB for short files, up to ~9GB for 3+ hour files.
- **Model variants**: v4 community model (`pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1`) preferred, with v3.1 fallback.
