"""Analytics computation service for media files.

This service computes speaker analytics, talk time statistics, and other metrics
that were previously computed on the frontend.

The service provides comprehensive analytics computation including:
- Speaker talk time analysis and percentage breakdowns
- Interruption detection and frequency tracking
- Turn-taking patterns and conversation flow analysis
- Question asking frequency by speaker
- Speaking pace calculations (words per minute)
- Silence ratio analysis for meeting efficiency
- Word count statistics across speakers

All analytics are computed server-side to ensure consistency and reduce
frontend complexity while providing detailed insights for meeting analysis.

Example:
    Basic usage for computing analytics for a media file:

    analytics = AnalyticsService.compute_analytics(db, media_file_id)
    if analytics:
        AnalyticsService.save_analytics(db, media_file_id, analytics)

Classes:
    AnalyticsService: Main service class for analytics computation.
