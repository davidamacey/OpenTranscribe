We're excited to officially announce the first release of OpenTranscribe! Version 0.1.0 marks a significant milestone in our journey from a weekend experiment to a production-ready AI transcription platform.

## Six Months of Innovation

What started in May 2025 as a simple weekend experiment has evolved into something far beyond our initial vision. What we expected to be a couple of weeks of development on nights and weekends turned into six months of passionate development, fueled by rapidly improving AI models and the incredible capabilities of modern development tools.

Impressively, the AI models got better throughout our development cycle, allowing us to add features we hadn't initially planned for. The speed of development, aided by frontier AI models from commercial providers, enabled us to build a comprehensive platform with all the core features we set out to create - and then some.

## Why v0.1.0? Our Path to v1.0.0

We're starting with version 0.1.0 rather than 1.0.0 for good reason. This gives us room to iterate, gather feedback, and make improvements based on real-world usage. We're working towards an official v1.0.0 release and will do our best to ensure backwards compatibility along the way.

**Important:** While we strive for stability, we cannot guarantee backwards compatibility until we reach v1.0.0. We will clearly announce any breaking changes in our release notes.

This approach allows us to:
- Gather community feedback on the current feature set
- Identify and fix issues in real-world deployments
- Refine the user experience based on actual usage patterns
- Make necessary architectural improvements before committing to long-term API stability

## Protecting Open Source with AGPL-3.0

One of the most important decisions we made for this release was changing our license from MIT to the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)**.

### Why AGPL-3.0?

We believe strongly in open source software and want to ensure OpenTranscribe remains truly open and accessible to everyone. The AGPL-3.0 license protects the open source nature of this project in several key ways:

1. **Network Copyleft Protection** - Unlike traditional open source licenses, AGPL-3.0 ensures that users accessing OpenTranscribe over a network have the right to access the source code. This is crucial for a web-based application.

2. **Preventing Proprietary Forks** - If someone modifies OpenTranscribe and offers it as a service, they must make their modifications available under the same AGPL-3.0 license. This ensures improvements benefit the entire community.

3. **Protecting Developers** - The license provides clear terms that protect both users and developers, ensuring everyone knows their rights and responsibilities.

4. **Ensuring Transparency** - Users have the right to know what code is running when they use software, especially when processing sensitive content like transcriptions.

5. **Building a Stronger Community** - By requiring modifications to remain open, we foster a collaborative environment where improvements are shared with everyone.

### What This Means for You

**You can still:**
- Use OpenTranscribe for personal projects
- Use it commercially in your business
- Modify the code to fit your needs
- Deploy it on your infrastructure
- Build products and services using it

**You must:**
- Keep the source code open if you modify and deploy it as a network service
- Provide access to the source code to users of your deployed instance
- Maintain the AGPL-3.0 license on modifications

**You don't need to:**
- Open source your own applications that simply *use* OpenTranscribe's API
- Share internal modifications if you're not offering it as a service to others

The AGPL-3.0 license aligns with our values of transparency, collaboration, and community-driven development. It ensures OpenTranscribe will always remain open source, even as it's adopted and modified by others.

## What's in v0.1.0?

## Use Open Source Models

One of our core principles is the use of open source AI models wherever possible. OpenTranscribe leverages:

- **WhisperX** - Open source speech recognition
- **PyAnnote.audio** - Open source speaker diarization
- **Sentence Transformers** - Open source semantic embeddings

While we support integration with commercial LLM providers for summarization, the core transcription and analysis features work entirely with open source models. You maintain full control over your data and processing.

## We Want Your Feedback!

This is just the beginning. We're excited to share OpenTranscribe with the world and eager to hear your feedback. Whether you're using it for:

- Meeting transcriptions
- Podcast production
- Academic research
- Legal documentation
- Customer service analysis
- Content creation

We want to know about your experience!
