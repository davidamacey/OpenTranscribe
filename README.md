## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Required
- Docker and Docker Compose
- 8GB+ RAM (16GB+ recommended)

# Recommended for optimal performance
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
```

### Quick Installation (Using Docker Hub Images)

Run this one-liner to download and set up OpenTranscribe using our pre-built Docker Hub images:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidamacey/OpenTranscribe/master/setup-opentranscribe.sh | bash
```

Then follow the on-screen instructions. The setup script will:
- Detect your hardware (NVIDIA GPU, Apple Silicon, or CPU)
- Download the production Docker Compose file
- Configure environment variables with optimal settings for your hardware
- **Prompt for your HuggingFace token** (required for speaker diarization)
- **Automatically download and cache AI models (~2.5GB)** if token is provided
- Set up the management script (`opentranscribe.sh`)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT - HuggingFace Setup:**
The script will prompt you for your HuggingFace token during setup. **BEFORE running the installer:**

1. **Get a FREE token:** Visit [https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
2. **Accept BOTH gated model agreements** (required for speaker diarization):
   - [pyannote/segmentation-3.0](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation-3.0) - Click "Agree and access repository"
   - [pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1) - Click "Agree and access repository"
3. **Enter your token** when prompted by the installer

If you provide a valid token with both model agreements accepted, AI models will be downloaded and cached before Docker starts, ensuring the app is ready to use immediately. If you skip this step, models will download on first use (10-30 minute delay).

Once setup is complete, start OpenTranscribe with:

```bash
cd opentranscribe
./opentranscribe.sh start
```

The Docker images are available on Docker Hub as separate repositories:

   OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o-mini

   # Start without local LLM
   ./opentr.sh start dev
   ```

2. **Local vLLM (Self-Hosted)**
   ```bash
   # Deploy vLLM server separately, then configure in .env
   LLM_PROVIDER=vllm
   VLLM_BASE_URL=http://your-vllm-server:8000/v1
   VLLM_MODEL_NAME=gpt-oss-20b

   # Start OpenTranscribe
   ./opentr.sh start dev
   ```

3. **Local Ollama (Self-Hosted)**
   ```bash
   # Deploy Ollama server separately, then configure in .env
   LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
   OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://your-ollama-server:11434
   OLLAMA_MODEL_NAME=llama3.2:3b-instruct-q4_K_M

   # Start OpenTranscribe
   ./opentr.sh start dev
   ```

**📋 Complete Provider Configuration:**
```bash
# Cloud Providers (configure in .env)
LLM_PROVIDER=openai                  # openai, anthropic, custom (openrouter)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key       # OpenAI GPT models
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_key    # Anthropic Claude models
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_or_key       # OpenRouter (multi-provider)

# Local Providers (requires additional Docker services)
LLM_PROVIDER=vllm                    # Local vLLM server
LLM_PROVIDER=ollama                  # Local Ollama server
```

**🎯 Deployment Scenarios:**
- **💰 Cost-Effective**: OpenRouter with Claude Haiku (~$0.25/1M tokens)
- **🔒 Privacy-First**: Local vLLM or Ollama (no data leaves your server)
- **⚡ Performance**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (fastest cloud option)
- **📱 Small Models**: Even 3B Ollama models can handle hours of content via intelligent sectioning
- **🚫 No LLM**: Leave `LLM_PROVIDER` empty for transcription-only mode

See [LLM_DEPLOYMENT_OPTIONS.md](LLM_DEPLOYMENT_OPTIONS.md) for detailed setup instructions.

#### **🗂️ Model Caching**

OpenTranscribe automatically downloads and caches AI models for optimal performance. Models are saved locally and reused across container restarts.

**Default Setup:**
- All models are cached to `./models/` directory in your project folder
- Models persist between Docker container restarts
- No re-downloading required after initial setup

**Directory Structure:**
```
./models/
├── huggingface/          # PyAnnote + WhisperX models
│   ├── hub/             # WhisperX transcription models (~1.5GB)
│   └── transformers/    # PyAnnote transformer models
└── torch/               # PyTorch cache
    ├── hub/checkpoints/ # Wav2Vec2 alignment model (~360MB)
    └── pyannote/        # PyAnnote diarization models (~500MB)
```

**Custom Cache Location:**
```bash
# Set custom directory in your .env file
MODEL_CACHE_DIR=/path/to/your/models

# Examples:
MODEL_CACHE_DIR=~/ai-models          # Home directory
MODEL_CACHE_DIR=/mnt/storage/models  # Network storage
MODEL_CACHE_DIR=./cache              # Project subdirectory
```

**Storage Requirements:**
- **WhisperX Models**: ~1.5GB (depends on model size)
- **PyAnnote Models**: ~500MB (diarization + embedding)
- **Alignment Model**: ~360MB (Wav2Vec2)
- **Total**: ~2.5GB for complete setup```

### **🔑 HuggingFace Token Setup**

OpenTranscribe requires a HuggingFace token for speaker diarization and voice fingerprinting features. Follow these steps:

#### **1. Generate HuggingFace Token**
1. Visit [HuggingFace Settings > Access Tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
2. Click "New token" and select "Read" access
3. Copy the generated token

#### **2. Accept Model User Agreements** ⚠️ **CRITICAL - MUST ACCEPT BOTH!**

**You MUST accept the user agreements for BOTH PyAnnote models or speaker diarization will fail:**

1. **Segmentation Model** (Required):
   - Visit: [pyannote/segmentation-3.0](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation-3.0)
   - Click: **"Agree and access repository"**

2. **Speaker Diarization Model** (Required):
   - Visit: [pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1)
   - Click: **"Agree and access repository"**

> **⚠️ Common Issue:** If you only accept one model agreement, downloads will fail with `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'eval'` error. You MUST accept BOTH agreements.

#### **3. Configure Token**
Add your token to the environment configuration:

**For Production Installation:**
```bash
# The setup script will prompt you for your token
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidamacey/OpenTranscribe/master/setup-opentranscribe.sh | bash
```

**For Manual Installation:**
```bash
# Add to .env file
echo "HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" >> .env
```

**Note:** Without a valid HuggingFace token, speaker diarization will be disabled and speakers will not be automatically detected or identified across different media files.

#### **Performance Tuning**
```bash
# GPU settings
USE_GPU=true                        # Enable GPU acceleration
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0              # GPU device selection

# Resource limits
MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE=4GB                 # Maximum file size (supports GoPro videos)
CELERY_WORKER_CONCURRENCY=2         # Concurrent tasks
```

### **Production Deployment**

For production use, ensure you:

1. **Security Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Generate strong secrets
   openssl rand -hex 32  # For SECRET_KEY
   openssl rand -hex 32  # For JWT_SECRET_KEY

   # Set strong database passwords
   # Configure proper firewall rules
   # Set up SSL/TLS certificates
   ```

2. **Performance Optimization**
   ```bash
   # Use production environment
   NODE_ENV=production

   # Configure resource limits
   # Set up monitoring and logging
   # Configure backup strategies
   ```

3. **HTTPS/SSL Setup** (Required for microphone recording from other devices)

   OpenTranscribe includes built-in NGINX reverse proxy support with SSL/TLS:

   ```bash
   # Quick setup for homelab/local network
   ./scripts/generate-ssl-cert.sh opentranscribe.local --auto-ip

   # Add to .env
   NGINX_SERVER_NAME=opentranscribe.local

   # Start with HTTPS enabled
   ./opentr.sh start dev
   ```

   For detailed instructions including Let's Encrypt setup, see [docs/NGINX_SETUP.md](docs/NGINX_SETUP.md).

   > **Note**: Modern browsers require HTTPS for microphone access. Without NGINX/SSL setup,
   > microphone recording will only work when accessing via `localhost`.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **GPU Not Detected**
```bash
# Check GPU availability
nvidia-smi

# Verify Docker GPU support
docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:11.0-base nvidia-smi

# Set CPU-only mode if needed
echo "USE_GPU=false" >> .env
```

#### **Permission Errors (Model Cache / yt-dlp)**

**Symptoms:**
- Error: `Permission denied: '/home/appuser/.cache/huggingface/hub'`
- Error: `Permission denied: '/home/appuser/.cache/yt-dlp'`
- YouTube downloads fail with permission errors
- Models fail to download or save

**Cause:** Docker creates model cache directories with root ownership, but containers run as non-root user (UID 1000) for security.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Option 1: Run the automated permission fix script (recommended)
cd opentranscribe  # Or your installation directory
./scripts/fix-model-permissions.sh

# Option 2: Manual fix using Docker
docker run --rm -v ./models:/models busybox chown -R 1000:1000 /models

# Option 3: Manual fix using sudo (if available)
sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./models
sudo chmod -R 755 ./models
```

**Prevention for New Installations:**
- The latest setup script automatically creates directories with correct permissions
- Re-run the one-line installer for new deployments:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidamacey/OpenTranscribe/master/setup-opentranscribe.sh | bash
  ```

**Why This Happens:**
- Different Linux users have different UIDs (e.g., 1001, 1002)
- Running setup as root creates root-owned directories
- Docker version differences affect directory creation behavior
- The containers run as UID 1000 for security (non-root user)

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check directory ownership (should show UID 1000 or your user)
ls -la models/

# Test write permissions
touch models/huggingface/test.txt && rm models/huggingface/test.txt
```

#### **Memory Issues**
```bash
# Reduce model size
echo "WHISPER_MODEL=medium" >> .env
echo "BATCH_SIZE=8" >> .env
echo "COMPUTE_TYPE=int8" >> .env

# Monitor memory usage
docker stats
```

#### **Slow Transcription**
- Use GPU acceleration (`USE_GPU=true`)
- Reduce model size (`WHISPER_MODEL=medium`)
- Increase batch size if you have GPU memory
- Split large files into smaller segments

#### **Database Connection Issues**
```bash
# Reset database
./opentr.sh reset dev

# Check database logs
./opentr.sh logs postgres

# Verify database is running
./opentr.sh shell postgres psql -U postgres -l
```

#### **Container Issues**
```bash
# Check service status
./opentr.sh status

# Clean up resources
./opentr.sh clean

# Full reset (⚠️ deletes all data)
./opentr.sh reset dev
```
