- **Offline/Airgapped Support** - Model downloading scripts for environments without internet access
- **Dynamic Model Management** - Add/remove embedding models via admin UI

#### Unified Transcription Pipeline
- **Native Word-Level Timestamps** - Word timestamps now provided natively by faster-whisper cross-attention DTW for all 100+ languages (previously only ~42 languages via wav2vec2 alignment)
- **Unified Pipeline** - Single streamlined transcription pipeline replaces the previous parallel_pipeline/whisperx_service split
- **User-Configurable VAD Settings** - Exposed Voice Activity Detection threshold and minimum silence duration as user-tunable settings
- **Word Timestamp Validation** - Post-processing validation and correction of word-level timestamps to prevent drift and ensure monotonicity

#### Performance Improvements
- **Default Model Change** - Switched from large-v2 to large-v3-turbo (6x faster transcription)
  - Note: large-v3-turbo cannot translate; use large-v3 for translation needs
- **Batch Size Optimization** - Intelligent batch sizing based on available VRAM
- **Neural Model Endpoints** - RESTful API for model lifecycle management
- **GPU Memory Leak Fixes** - Gated model preloading with `PRELOAD_GPU_MODELS` env var to prevent 15 GB CPU worker leak; forced CPU for speaker clustering under 500 speakers to prevent 44 GB prefork child leak
- **Vectorized Speaker Assignment** - NumPy matmul replaces O(n×m) linear scan, 13x speedup (80s → 6s for 4.7-hour files)
- **TF32 Acceleration** - Enabled at worker startup and after diarization for Ampere+ GPUs
- **GPU Pipeline Benchmarks** - 40.3x single-file realtime, 54.6x peak at concurrency=8, perfect linear scaling 1–12 workers on RTX A6000

#### Cloud ASR Providers
- **Multi-Provider Cloud ASR** - 8 cloud speech providers: Deepgram, AssemblyAI, OpenAI Whisper API, Google, AWS Transcribe, Azure Speech, Speechmatics, Gladia (#150)
- **pyannote.ai Integration** - Cloud diarization via pyannote.ai API (`/v1/diarize`)
- **Independent Diarization Provider Architecture** - `diarization_source` selector with four modes: ASR built-in, local (PyAnnote GPU), pyannote.ai cloud, or off — independent of transcription provider choice
- **API-Lite Deployment Mode** - CPU-only image (~2 GB vs 8.9 GB) for organizations without GPUs; cloud-transcribed files still get local speaker embedding extraction for cross-file matching
- **Custom Vocabulary** - Domain-specific hotwords (medical, legal, corporate, government) used as faster-whisper hotwords and cloud provider keyword boosting
- **Admin-Pinned ASR Model** - Admins control local Whisper model selection; model loaded once at startup, shared across all workers; per-user override removed
- **Per-Transcription Model Selection** - Users can override the admin-pinned model per upload (#153)

#### Speaker Intelligence
- **Speaker Pre-Clustering** - GPU-accelerated speaker clustering groups speakers across files based on voice similarity (#144)
- **Global Speaker Management Page** - Dedicated page for cross-file speaker profile management
- **Gender Classification** - Neural network gender prediction from voice characteristics using Apache 2.0 licensed model; results stored on profiles for cross-video consistency
- **Gender-Informed Cluster Validation** - Cross-gender cluster assignment requires higher similarity threshold; minority-gender members flagged for review
- **Speaker Profile Avatars** - Avatar images for speaker profiles
- **Jump-to-Timestamp Links** - Speaker editor includes links to timestamps in transcript (#147)
- **Speaker Metadata Parsing** - Cross-reference pipeline with metadata hints display for LLM-assisted speaker identification (#141)
- **Unassign and Blacklist** - Remove speaker assignments and blacklist erroneous profiles
- **Outlier Analysis** - Detect and flag outlier embeddings in speaker clusters
- **Play/Pause Toggle** - Inline audio playback in speaker cluster views
- **OpenSearch Cosine Score Fix** - OS `cosinesimil` returns `(1+cos)/2`; all 8 kNN score read locations now convert to raw cosine (`2.0 * score - 1.0`)
- **Profile Embedding Fix** - `add_speaker_to_profile_embedding` now delegates to `update_profile_embedding` for correct centroid averaging

#### Search Improvements
- **Hybrid Search Overhaul** - Fixed OpenSearch 3.4 `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` crash when using `aggs` + `hybrid` + `collapse` + RRF pipeline (was silently falling back to BM25-only)
- **Score Gate Removed** - Replaced hard suppression with soft demotion (`_apply_semantic_demotion`); semantic results no longer dropped
- **Dynamic Over-Fetch** - Cap raised from 200 to 1000 via `SEARCH_MAX_OVERFETCH` env var for large indexes
- **BM25 Improvements** - Fuzziness AUTO, cross-fields, phrase slop; rank_constant 40→30
- **Stop/Cancel Reindex** - Cancel in-flight reindex operations from Admin UI (#5994)
- **Search Reliability** - Word-boundary regex for RRF collapse fallback; synthetic highlights for semantic results

#### Collaboration & Sharing
- **User Groups & Collection Sharing** - Create user groups and share collections with groups or individual users (#148)
- **Speaker Profile Sharing** - Share speaker profiles via collection sharing infrastructure
- **Config/Prompt Sharing** - Share LLM configs, prompts, media sources, and org contexts between users
- **Per-Collection AI Prompts** - Different AI summarization prompts for different collections (#146)
- **Bidirectional Prompt-Collection Links** - Prompts show linked collections on their cards

#### Upload & Media

- **Multi-GPU Stats with Stepper UI** - Real-time per-GPU stats display with stepper interface
- **Resumable Upload Sessions** - TUS protocol session management in database
- **Progressive Web App (PWA) & Mobile Overhaul** - Installable PWA, 2-column mobile grid, hamburger nav, full-screen modals, scroll locking, touch-optimized UI (#155)
- **Security Hardening** - CSP headers, private MinIO buckets, AES-256-GCM encryption, non-root containers, FIPS 140-3 readiness
- **Auto-Labeling** - AI suggests tags and collections from transcript content with fuzzy deduplication (#140)
- **Codebase Modularization** - 9 new shared backend modules, 6 new UI components, speaker task splits, dead code removal
- **Embedded Documentation** - New `opentranscribe-docs` container serving the Docusaurus documentation site; accessible at `/docs/` through the app's NGINX proxy (and `http://localhost:3030/docs/` directly); fully offline-capable for air-gapped deployments

#### Authentication Additions (v0.3.3 integrated)
- **Keycloak Federated Logout** - Session termination propagates to Keycloak OIDC end-session endpoint (#125)
- **Super Admin PKI + Local Password Fallback** - PKI-authenticated super admins can retain local password as fallback (#127)

#### Upload Modal Redesign
- **6-Step Stepper Flow** - Replaced the accordion-inside-modal upload UX with a linear stepper: Media → Tags → Collections → Speakers → Options → Submit. Conditional Extract step appears automatically for large video files
- **Unified Across All Upload Sources** - File, URL, and recording uploads now share steps 2-6, so URL downloads and recordings gain full access to tags/collections/speaker settings (previously file-only)
- **Remember Previous Values** - Upload modal pre-fills tags, collections, speaker settings, whisper model, and skip-summary from the last upload. One-click "Review with defaults" shortcut lets power users jump straight to submit
- **Clickable Stepper Navigation** - Users can click any previously-visited step to go back and edit. Dot + label is a single clickable button per step (Fitts's Law / Apple HIG 44×44pt touch-target compliance)
- **Decomposed Monolith** - The 4,603-line `FileUploader.svelte` split into a 1,294-line coordinator plus 9 focused components under `frontend/src/components/upload/` (each under ~470 lines). New `upload-shared.css` provides a unified chip/dropdown pattern reused across tags and collections
- **Conditional Extraction Step** - Large video files (>100MB by default) trigger an inline Extract step with radio-button choice (Extract Audio Only vs Upload Full Video). Extraction runs on final Submit, not at selection time, so users can still change their mind while stepping through tags/collections
- **Backdrop-Click No Longer Closes** - Modal only closes via X button or Escape key, preventing data loss from stray clicks on in-progress upload state

#### Skeleton Loaders on Major Pages
- **Structural Loading States** - Replaced generic `<Spinner size="large">` on home gallery, search results, file detail page, and speaker clusters/profiles/inbox with skeleton components that mirror the final layout. Perceived load time ~20% faster per Nielsen Norman research
- **Reusable Skeleton Components** - New `FileDetailSkeleton.svelte` (full 2-column layout with header/video/transcript), `ui/CardGridSkeleton.svelte` (parametric with media/profile/search variants), and `ui/ListRowSkeleton.svelte` (avatar + title + actions rows)
- **Gallery Click Feedback** - Clicking a file card now dims + scales it instantly (opacity 0.72, scale 0.985) with `pointer-events: none` to prevent double-clicks. Prefetch kicks off on `mousedown` ~50-100ms before the click handler runs

#### Collection & Share Modal Polish
- **Help Text and Empty States** - Create/Edit Collection modals gained intro banners explaining what collections are, field hints with `maxlength` indicators, and proper `aria-labelledby` wiring
- **Universal Content Analyzer Default** - New collections auto-select the system-default prompt (via `is_system_default` lookup), matching the behavior users typically want without requiring manual selection
- **Share Modal Intro and Permission Guide** - Share Collection modal now includes an introductory explanation, a collection name banner with folder icon, and a visible permission-level reference card showing Viewer/Editor labels inline with descriptions (previously only in tooltips). Empty state added for collections with no existing shares
- **Manage Collections Visual Fix** - Fixed nested-card glitch where the inner `.collections-panel` had its own surface background inside the outer modal container, producing a visible "card in a card" look

### Security

#### Frontend Session Hardening
- **Flash of Authenticated Content (FOAC) fix** - `+layout.svelte` now gates all protected content behind `authReady && isAuthenticated && !isPublicPath`, showing a loading screen in route-mismatch states while async redirects are in flight. Previously, unauthenticated users hitting `/` briefly saw the gallery slot render before the redirect fired, leaking ~1-2 frames of protected UI and triggering `/files` API calls
- **Centralized User State Cleanup** - New `frontend/src/lib/session/clearUserState.ts` is the single source of truth for session teardown. Clears 17+ subsystems on every login/logout transition: toast, websocket, uploads, gallery filters, search results, sharing, LLM status, settings modal, transcript, groups, downloads, notifications, recording (with media track cleanup), thumbnail cache, media URL cache, speaker colors, plus user-scoped localStorage keys. Preferences (theme, locale, view mode, recording settings) are explicitly preserved. Replaces ad-hoc cleanup previously scattered across `auth.ts`
- **Session-Scoped Request Cancellation** - Session-scoped `AbortController` in `lib/axios.ts` attached to every request via interceptor (except `/auth/login`, `/auth/logout`, `/auth/token/refresh` which must always complete). `logout()` now calls `abortAllRequests()` before `clearUserState()`, closing the race window where a late API response could repopulate a cleared store with stale data from the previous session. New `isRequestCancelled()` helper exported for catch blocks to suppress error toasts on cancelled requests
- **bfcache Invalidation on Back Button** - `+layout.svelte` now listens for `pageshow` events with `event.persisted === true` and forces `window.location.reload()` to discard the restored DOM/JS snapshot. Prevents users from hitting the back button after logout and seeing the previously-protected page restored from memory on shared devices
- **Toast Cross-Session Leak Fixed** - `toastStore.clear()` is called from every login success path (local, Keycloak callback, PKI, MFA) and from `logout()` via `clearUserState()`. Previously, notifications from User A's session could persist into User B's login screen or the next user's session
- **Keycloak Redirect URL Validation** - `loginWithKeycloak()` now parses and validates the `authorization_url` returned by `/auth/keycloak/login` (requires `http:` or `https:` protocol) before calling `window.location.href`. Prevents open-redirect or `javascript:`/`data:` URL injection if upstream config drifts

#### XSS Hardening
- **DOMPurify-Backed HTML Sanitization** - New `lib/utils/sanitizeHtml.ts` provides `sanitizeHighlightHtml()` (whitelist allows `mark`, `span`, `br`, `ul`, `li`, `em`, `strong`, `div`, `p` with `class` and `data-match-index` attributes) and `sanitizeToPlainText()`. Added `dompurify` and `@types/dompurify` as dependencies
- **Defense-in-Depth Across 8 Render Sites** - Wrapped every `{@html}` directive that renders API-sourced or LLM-generated content with `sanitizeHighlightHtml()`: TopicsList, TranscriptDisplay, TranscriptModal, SearchTranscriptModal, SearchOccurrence, SearchResultCard, SummaryDisplay
- **Bypassable Regex Sanitizer Replaced** - `SearchOccurrence.svelte` and `SearchResultCard.svelte` previously used `html.replace(/<(?!\/?mark[\s>])[^>]*>/g, '')` which was bypassable via `</mark><script>alert(1)</script><mark>` payloads (the regex only matched opening tags). Now uses DOMPurify with a strict tag whitelist

#### Build & Configuration Hardening
- **Production Source Maps Disabled** - `vite.config.ts` now uses `sourcemap: mode !== 'production'`, ensuring `.js.map` files are only generated for dev/preview builds. Previously, production builds shipped source maps exposing variable names, API endpoint URIs, error messages, and full business logic to any visitor via DevTools or automated crawlers
- **Defense-in-Depth Home Page Guard** - `routes/+page.svelte` `onMount` now early-returns if `!get(isAuthenticated)`, preventing `fetchFiles()` and WebSocket subscriptions from running if the component is somehow mounted unauthenticated (belt-and-suspenders beyond the layout-level route guard)

### Changed

- **Default Whisper Model** - Changed from `large-v2` to `large-v3-turbo` for significantly faster transcription with maintained accuracy
  - New default: `WHISPER_MODEL=large-v3-turbo` (6x faster, excellent for English and most languages)
  - For translation to English: Use `WHISPER_MODEL=large-v3` (large-v3-turbo cannot translate)
  - For maximum accuracy: Use `WHISPER_MODEL=large-v3` (slightly better accuracy than turbo)
- **PyAnnote Embedding Dimension** - v4 uses 256-dim embeddings instead of 192-dim for better voice matching
- **Speaker Embedding Storage** - Database schema updated to support v3/v4 dual-mode during migration
- **Authentication Configuration** - Moved from environment variables to database for better security and manageability
- **Model Caching** - Improved caching strategy with warm-start support and automatic prefetching
- **Word-Level Timestamps** - Now native for all 100+ languages via cross-attention DTW (previously only ~42 languages supported via wav2vec2 alignment model)
- **Transcription Pipeline** - Consolidated into a single unified pipeline; removed separate parallel pipeline and WhisperX service layer

### Removed

- **wav2vec2 Alignment Model** - No longer needed; word-level timestamps are now native via faster-whisper cross-attention DTW
- **`whisperx_service.py`** - Removed separate WhisperX service abstraction (functionality merged into unified pipeline)
- **`parallel_pipeline.py`** - Removed parallel pipeline module (replaced by unified pipeline)
- **`pyannote_compat.py`** - Removed PyAnnote compatibility shim
- **`fast_speaker_assignment.py`** - Removed custom speaker assignment utility (using WhisperX built-in assignment)
- **`batched_alignment.py`** - Removed batched alignment utility (alignment no longer needed)
- **`ENABLE_ALIGNMENT` env var** - Deprecated and ignored (alignment is always-on natively)
- **`TRANSCRIPTION_ENGINE` env var** - Deprecated and ignored (single unified engine)

### Breaking Changes

- **Authentication Configuration**: Auth settings now configured via Super Admin UI (Settings → Authentication) instead of environment variables. Database configuration takes precedence if set.
- **PyAnnote Migration**: Existing installations may need to migrate speaker embeddings for optimal overlap detection (optional but recommended)
- **wav2vec2 Alignment Model Removed**: The separate wav2vec2 alignment model is no longer used. Word-level timestamps are now provided natively by faster-whisper cross-attention DTW. The `ENABLE_ALIGNMENT` and `TRANSCRIPTION_ENGINE` environment variables are deprecated and silently ignored.

### Fixed

- Speaker overlap detection accuracy improved
- Neural search relevance and ranking improved (hybrid search was silently falling back to BM25-only due to OpenSearch 3.4 crash)
- Authentication rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- PKI certificate validation with OCSP/CRL revocation checking
- OpenSearch cosine similarity scores now correctly converted from OS range `(1+cos)/2` to raw cosine
- Speaker profile centroid embeddings now correctly averaged across all constituent embeddings
- GPU memory leaks fixed (CPU worker CUDA context initialization, prefork child VRAM leak)
- HuggingFace gated model authentication for PyAnnote diarization
- Login flicker and empty-state flash on navigation eliminated
- YouTube bot-bypass anti-blocking with 2026 yt-dlp best practices (Deno JS runtime, client rotation)
- Admin bypass and shared editor access across all API endpoints
- Alembic migration chain linearized after branch merges
- LDAP user bcrypt crash when verifying non-local passwords
- **WebSocket notification queue leak** - `clearAll()` now called on logout; previously persisted in localStorage across sessions, exposing User A's notification history to User B on shared devices
- **Upload queue persistence leak** - `localStorage['upload_queue']` is now cleared on logout via new `uploadsStore.reset()`; previously leaked file UUIDs, metadata, and processing status across sessions
- **Dropdown clipping in upload modal** - Removed nested `overflow-y: auto` on the stepper body that was clipping tag and collection dropdowns. Primary modal container now handles all scrolling with `z-index: 200` on the dropdown list
- **Double-card visual in Manage Collections** - `.collections-panel` previously had its own `surface-color` background + border inside the outer modal container, producing a visible "card in a card" look. Root set to `background: transparent` when rendered inside the modal
- **Debug console.logs removed** - `AuthenticationSettings.svelte` no longer logs full auth config on every load; `files/[id]/+page.svelte` no longer logs every 5 minutes on video URL refresh
- **Dead code removed** - Deleted unused `routes/Tasks.svelte.old` (868 lines) and the unused `AudioExtractionModal.svelte` (replaced by inline stepper step)
- **Avatar lazy-loading** - Profile and cluster avatars on the Speakers page now use `loading="lazy"` and `decoding="async"`, preventing synchronous load-block on page init

### Upgrade Notes

#### Standard Upgrade (Non-Breaking)

```bash
# Pull latest images
docker compose pull

# Restart services (automatically runs migrations)
docker compose up -d
```

After upgrading, users should **hard-reload the frontend** (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R) to pick up the new service worker and clear any stale cached assets. The service worker will automatically cache the new build on next visit.

The system will automatically detect the authentication configuration mode and function correctly. To use new authentication features:

1. Log in as super admin
2. Navigate to Settings → Authentication
3. Enable desired authentication methods
4. Configure each method in its dedicated section

#### PyAnnote v4 Migration (Optional)

To take advantage of new speaker overlap detection and improved performance:

1. Navigate to Settings → Embeddings
2. Click "Migrate to PyAnnote v4"
3. Monitor progress with the real-time progress bar
4. No restart required

#### Model Selection for Your Language

- **English audio**: Keep default `large-v3-turbo` for fastest transcription
- **Non-English (no translation needed)**: Keep default `large-v3-turbo` for 6x faster speed
- **Translation to English**: Switch to `large-v3` (turbo cannot translate)
  - In Settings → Transcription → Model Selection, choose `large-v3`
- **Maximum accuracy needed**: Switch to `large-v3` for best overall accuracy
  - In Settings → Transcription → Model Selection, choose `large-v3`

#### wav2vec2 Model Cache Cleanup (Optional)

The wav2vec2 alignment model is no longer used. You can reclaim ~360MB of disk space by removing it from your model cache:

```bash
# Remove wav2vec2 alignment model cache (~360MB)
rm -rf ${MODEL_CACHE_DIR:-./models}/torch/hub/checkpoints/wav2vec2_*
```

No reprocessing of existing transcriptions is needed -- existing word-level timestamps are preserved.

#### Environment Variable Cleanup (Optional)

The following environment variables are deprecated and silently ignored. You may remove them from your `.env` file:

```bash
# These can be safely removed from .env:
# ENABLE_ALIGNMENT=true        (alignment is now always-on natively)
# TRANSCRIPTION_ENGINE=whisperx (single unified engine, setting ignored)
```

## [0.3.2] - 2025-12-17

### Overview
Patch release fixing critical bugs in the one-liner installation script that prevented successful setup on fresh installations.

**Note:** This is a scripts-only release. No Docker container rebuild required.

### Fixed

#### Setup Script Fixes
- **Scripts Directory Creation** - Fixed curl error 23 ("Failure writing output to destination") when downloading SSL and permission scripts by creating the `scripts/` directory before download attempts
- **PyTorch 2.6+ Compatibility** - Applied `torch.load` patch to `download-models.py` for PyTorch 2.6+ compatibility, mirroring the fix already present in the backend (from Wes Brown's commit 8929cd6)
  - PyTorch 2.6 changed `weights_only` default to `True`, causing omegaconf deserialization errors during model downloads
  - The patch sets `weights_only=False` for trusted HuggingFace models

### Upgrade Notes

For existing installations, no action required - Docker containers already have the PyTorch fix.

For new installations, the one-liner setup script will now work correctly:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidamacey/OpenTranscribe/master/setup-opentranscribe.sh | bash
```
