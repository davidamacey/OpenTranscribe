### Processing Steps

1. **Voice Activity Detection**: Identify speech vs silence
2. **Speaker Embedding**: Extract voice fingerprints
3. **Overlap Detection**: Find overlapping speakers
4. **Clustering**: Group similar voices
5. **Speaker Assignment**: Label each segment

### Speaker Fingerprinting

Each speaker gets a unique voice embedding:
- 256-dimensional vector (PyAnnote v4)
- Captures voice characteristics with high precision
- Used for cross-video matching
- Enables speaker recognition across videos

## Speaker Management

### Automatic Detection

- Detects 1-50+ speakers automatically
- No manual configuration required
- Adaptive to conversation dynamics
- Handles speaker interruptions

### Speaker Profiles

**Create persistent speaker profiles**:

1. Label "Speaker 1" as "John Doe"
2. System creates global profile
3. Profile matches across all videos
4. Voice fingerprint stored for matching

### Cross-Video Recognition

**Intelligent speaker matching**:

- Voice embedding comparison
- Similarity scoring (0-100%)
- High-confidence auto-linking (greater than 85%)
- Manual verification for medium confidence
- Speaker appears in multiple recordings

**Example**:
```
Video 1: John Doe speaks
Video 2: Unknown speaker detected
System: 92% match → Suggests "John Doe"
```

## Speaker Analytics

### Talk Time Analysis

- Total speaking duration per speaker
- Percentage of conversation

- Identifies speakers by role/expertise
- Detects names mentioned in conversation
- Provides confidence scores

**Example**:
```
Context: "As the CEO mentioned earlier..."
AI Suggestion: "John Smith (CEO)" - 85% confidence
```

### Verification Workflow

1. AI suggests speaker name
2. Review suggestion + confidence
3. Accept or manually correct
4. System learns from corrections

## Configuration

### Detection Range

Adjust speaker count expectations:

```bash
# .env configuration
MIN_SPEAKERS=1   # Minimum speakers

## Performance Optimization

OpenTranscribe v4 includes several optimizations to speed up speaker diarization processing:

### Warm Model Caching

**What it does**: AI models are loaded into memory on server startup and kept warm between transcriptions.

**Benefits**:
- **40-60 seconds faster** on first transcription after startup
- Subsequent transcriptions use pre-loaded models
- No repeated model initialization overhead
- Configurable cache location via `MODEL_CACHE_DIR` environment variable

**How it works**:
```bash
# Models cached in these locations
${MODEL_CACHE_DIR}/huggingface/        # PyAnnote transformer model (~500MB)
${MODEL_CACHE_DIR}/torch/pyannote/      # PyAnnote voice embeddings
```

### Fast Speaker Assignment

**What it does**: PyAnnote v4 uses optimized clustering algorithms for speaker detection.

**Performance**:
- **273x faster** than previous speaker assignment methods
- Clustering completes in milliseconds vs seconds
- Particularly noticeable on high-speaker-count files (10+ speakers)

**Technical**: Uses sklearn's `AgglomerativeClustering` with optimized similarity thresholds

### Optional Word-Level Alignment Toggle

**What it does**: The system can optionally align transcript words to precise timing in the audio.

**Performance Impact**:
- **Saves 17-120 seconds** per file depending on duration
- Slower on languages without pre-trained alignment models (~42 languages have full support)
- Can be disabled in user settings if speed is critical

**When to disable**:
- Processing very long files (4+ hours) for speed
- Languages without alignment support (fallback to segment-level timing)
- Batch processing large volumes where precision timing isn't needed

**User Configuration**:
- Can be toggled per-user in Settings → Transcription
- Can be overridden per-file during upload

## Technical Deep Dive

### Why Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC)?

PyAnnote's diarization pipeline uses sklearn's `AgglomerativeClustering` for grouping speaker embeddings. This was chosen over several alternatives after evaluating tradeoffs across accuracy, scalability, and operational characteristics ([#144](https://github.com/davidamacey/OpenTranscribe/issues/144)):

| Algorithm | K Required? | Handles Outliers? | Incremental? | Complexity | Verdict |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|-------------|------------|---------|
| **AHC (chosen)** | No (threshold-based) | No | No | O(n^2 log n) | Best for per-file diarization with unknown speaker count |
| K-Means | Yes | No | Limited | O(nKI) | Requires knowing speaker count in advance -- unusable for diarization |
| Spectral | Yes (or auto-tune) | No | No | O(n^3) | Cubic complexity prohibitive for long files; used internally by PyAnnote for refinement |
| DBSCAN | No (needs epsilon) | Yes | No | O(n log n) | Good for cross-file batch clustering but epsilon tuning is fragile for variable-quality audio |
| HDBSCAN | No | Yes (noise points) | No | O(n log n) | Best for periodic batch re-clustering across files; overkill for single-file diarization |

AHC with a cosine similarity distance threshold is the standard approach in speaker diarization research because it does not require pre-specifying the number of speakers (K). Instead, it merges clusters until the inter-cluster distance exceeds a tuned threshold. This matches the real-world scenario where the number of speakers in a recording is unknown. NVIDIA NeMo's speaker verification pipeline uses a similar cosine similarity threshold of 0.7 as a reference point.

For cross-file speaker management at scale, OpenTranscribe uses a hybrid approach: real-time kNN assignment via OpenSearch HNSW (O(log n) per speaker) for immediate cluster routing, with periodic HDBSCAN batch re-clustering to discover groups missed by incremental assignment.

### Cosine Similarity Thresholds

Speaker matching thresholds were calibrated against industry benchmarks from Pindrop (5B+ calls processed), NVIDIA NeMo, and internal testing:

| Threshold | Action | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| >= 0.90 | Auto-accept (automated merging) | Extremely high confidence; false positive rate negligible |
| 0.75 - 0.90 | Strong suggestion, user confirmation | Matches OpenTranscribe's `SPEAKER_CONFIDENCE_HIGH`; conservative to prevent false merges |
| 0.65 - 0.75 | Cluster formation | Follows WeSpeaker's UMAP + HDBSCAN recipe threshold; groups likely-same speakers |
| 0.50 - 0.65 | Weak suggestion | Presented as option but not auto-applied |
| < 0.50 | Different speakers | Industry standard cutoff |

The conservative auto-merge threshold (0.90) was chosen specifically to prevent false positive merges, which are harder to recover from than missed matches. Profile coherence monitoring flags profiles where constituent embeddings have minimum pairwise similarity below 0.60, indicating a potential false merge.

### Why 256-Dimensional WeSpeaker Embeddings

PyAnnote v4 switched from 192-dimensional pyannote/embedding (v3) to 256-dimensional WeSpeaker ResNet34-LM embeddings. This was not simply a version bump -- it reflects a deliberate accuracy-performance tradeoff:

- **Accuracy**: WeSpeaker ResNet34-LM achieves state-of-the-art results on VoxCeleb benchmarks. The 256-dim space provides a richer representation than 192-dim while remaining computationally efficient.
- **Speed**: 273x faster speaker assignment (from ~3 seconds to ~11ms per speaker) due to optimized ONNX runtime and better clustering algorithms in v4.
- **Storage**: 256-dim vectors are 33% larger than 192-dim but 50% smaller than the 512-dim embeddings used by the legacy pyannote/embedding model. At scale (30,000 speakers), the full OpenSearch index remains under 32MB.
- **L2-normalization**: All embeddings are L2-normalized before storage, which means cosine similarity reduces to a simple dot product -- enabling efficient HNSW search in OpenSearch.

The 512-dim pyannote/embedding model is retained in the `speakers_v3` index for backward compatibility and can be used as a fallback. The alias-based index architecture allows atomic switching between v3 and v4 without downtime (see [Embedding Migration](../configuration/embedding-migration.md)).

### Gender Classification Model Selection

Speaker attribute detection uses the `prithivMLmods/Wav2Vec2-Gender-Age-Classification` model ([#141](https://github.com/davidamacey/OpenTranscribe/issues/141)). This model was selected based on three criteria:

1. **Apache 2.0 licensing**: Unlike many voice classification models that use restrictive research-only licenses, this model's Apache 2.0 license permits commercial and production use without legal risk. This was a hard requirement for OpenTranscribe's open-source distribution.
2. **Language independence**: The model analyzes acoustic features (pitch, formant frequencies, timbre) rather than linguistic content, so it works across all 100+ supported transcription languages without retraining.
3. **Lightweight inference**: Runs on CPU (~1-3 seconds per speaker) as a separate Celery task on the `cpu` queue, so it never blocks GPU resources needed for transcription and diarization.

### Gender-Informed Cluster Validation

Predicted gender is used as a validation signal for speaker clusters, not as a primary clustering feature. When a speaker cluster contains members with conflicting gender predictions, the system applies a cross-gender penalty:

- **Same predicted gender**: Standard cosine similarity threshold (0.65) for cluster membership.
- **Cross-gender assignment**: Requires a higher similarity threshold to join the cluster, reducing false merges between speakers of different genders who happen to have similar acoustic profiles.
- **Minority-gender members**: If a cluster has a dominant gender prediction (e.g., 8 male, 1 female), the minority member is flagged for manual review as a potential mis-assignment.

This approach improves cluster purity without over-relying on gender prediction accuracy, which can be unreliable for children, whispered speech, or heavily processed audio.

## Troubleshooting

### Too Many Speakers Detected

**Solutions**:
- Lower MAX_SPEAKERS
- Improve audio quality
- Merge duplicate speakers manually

### Too Few Speakers Detected

**Solutions**:
- Increase MAX_SPEAKERS
- Check audio has multiple distinct voices
- Verify speakers have different vocal characteristics

### Poor Speaker Separation

**Causes**:
- Similar-sounding voices
- Poor audio quality
- Heavy background noise

**Solutions**:
- Use better microphones
- Separate speakers physically
- Post-process manually
