/**
 * HTML sanitization utility backed by DOMPurify.
 *
 * Use this for any `{@html ...}` directive that renders content derived from:
 * - API responses (LLM summaries, transcripts, speaker names, file titles, tags)
 * - User input (search queries, comments)
 * - Any string built via concatenation/interpolation with untrusted sources
 *
 * The existing search-highlight pipeline escapes text before wrapping it in
 * `<span>`/`<mark>` tags, which is safe when done correctly. Running everything
 * through DOMPurify as a final pass is defense-in-depth — if a future code
 * change forgets to escape, DOMPurify catches it.
 *
 * Do NOT use this for static literal HTML hard-coded in components (e.g., icon
 * SVGs defined inline). That's trusted content and doesn't need sanitization.
