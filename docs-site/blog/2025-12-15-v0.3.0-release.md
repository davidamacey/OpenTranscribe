We're excited to announce OpenTranscribe v0.3.0! This release integrates valuable contributions from the community fork by [@vfilon](https://github.com/vfilon), bringing major new features including support for 1800+ video platforms and production-ready NGINX reverse proxy with SSL/TLS.

## Fork Integration Success Story

This release demonstrates the power of open source collaboration. [@vfilon](https://github.com/vfilon) created a fork of OpenTranscribe and developed several excellent features. Rather than letting these improvements exist in isolation, we've integrated them back into the main project, crediting the original contributor.

**Features adopted from the vfilon fork:**
- Universal Media URL support concept
- NGINX reverse proxy configuration
- Task status reconciliation improvements
- GPU overlay separation

Thank you, [@vfilon](https://github.com/vfilon), for your contributions to the project!

## What's New in v0.3.0

### Universal Media URL Support (1800+ Platforms)

The headline feature of this release expands OpenTranscribe far beyond YouTube:

**Supported Platforms:**
- **Primary (Best Support)**: YouTube, Dailymotion, Twitter/X
- **Secondary**: Vimeo (public only), TikTok (variable), and 1800+ more via yt-dlp

**Features:**
- Dynamic source platform detection from yt-dlp metadata
- User-friendly error messages for authentication-required platforms
- Platform guidance for common issues (Vimeo login, Instagram restrictions, etc.)
- Updated UI with "Supported Platforms" section and limitations warning

**Note:** Authentication is not currently supported. Videos requiring login will fail with helpful error messages guiding users to publicly accessible alternatives.

### NGINX Reverse Proxy with SSL/TLS

This release closes [Issue #72](https://github.com/davidamacey/OpenTranscribe/issues/72), enabling browser microphone recording on remote network access:

**Features:**
- `docker-compose.nginx.yml` overlay for production deployments
- Full SSL/TLS configuration with HTTP → HTTPS redirect
- WebSocket proxy support for real-time updates
- 2GB file upload support for large media files
- Flower dashboard and MinIO console accessible through NGINX
- Self-signed certificate generation script

**Setup:**
```bash
# Set your domain in .env
NGINX_SERVER_NAME=transcribe.example.com

# Generate self-signed certificate (or use Let's Encrypt)
./scripts/generate-ssl-cert.sh

# Start with NGINX
./opentr.sh start prod
```

See `docs/NGINX_SETUP.md` for complete setup instructions.

### Critical Bug Fixes: UUID/ID Standardization

This release includes a comprehensive fix for UUID/ID handling across 60+ files:

**Issues Fixed:**
- Speaker recommendations not showing for new videos
- Profile embedding service returning wrong ID type
- Inconsistent ID handling between backend and frontend
- Comment system UUID issues
- Password reset flow problems

**Technical Details:**
- Backend now consistently uses integer IDs for database operations
- API responses use UUIDs for external communication
- Frontend consistently uses UUID strings for all entity references

### Infrastructure Improvements

**GPU Configuration:**
- Separated into optional `docker-compose.gpu.yml` overlay
- Better cross-platform support (macOS, CPU-only systems)
- Auto-detection in `opentr.sh` script

**Task Management:**
- Task status reconciliation before marking files as stuck
- Multiple timestamp fallbacks for better reliability
- Auto-refresh analytics when segment speaker changes

**LLM Service:**
- Ollama context window configuration (`num_ctx` parameter)
- Model-aware temperature handling
- Better logging with resolved endpoint info

## i18n Updates

All 7 supported languages have been updated:
- Notification text changed from "YouTube Processing" to "Video Processing"
- New media URL description and platform limitation strings
- Updated recommended platforms list

## How to Update

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
# Pull the latest images
docker compose pull

# Restart with new images
docker compose up -d
```

### For NGINX/SSL Setup

```bash
# Copy environment template if needed
cp .env.example .env

# Set NGINX_SERVER_NAME in .env
# Generate certificates
./scripts/generate-ssl-cert.sh

# Start with NGINX
./opentr.sh start prod
```
