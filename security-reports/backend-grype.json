The issue occurs in the internal function responsible for converting cryptographic keys into serialized formats. During error handling, a memory structure is freed but not cleared, leading to a potential double free issue if an additional failure occurs later in the function. This condition may result in heap corruption or application instability in low-memory scenarios, posing a risk to system reliability where key export operations are performed.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-5351","epss":0.00047,"percentile":0.14436,"date":"2025-11-04"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"package":{"name":"libssh","version":"0.10.6-0+deb12u1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-5351","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"f2a719b78263a00d","name":"libssh-gcrypt-4","version":"0.10.6-0+deb12u1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:6694d1a3720e64bfec92650469bd8b93edb8a395767dad869c24a2135175f176","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libssh-gcrypt-4/copyright","layerID":"sha256:6694d1a3720e64bfec92650469bd8b93edb8a395767dad869c24a2135175f176","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libssh-gcrypt-4/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libssh-gcrypt-4:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:6694d1a3720e64bfec92650469bd8b93edb8a395767dad869c24a2135175f176","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libssh-gcrypt-4:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-clause","BSD-3-clause","LGPL-2.1","LGPL-2.1+~OpenSSL","public-domain"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libssh-gcrypt-4:libssh-gcrypt-4:0.10.6-0\\+deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssh-gcrypt-4:libssh_gcrypt_4:0.10.6-0\\+deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssh_gcrypt_4:libssh-gcrypt-4:0.10.6-0\\+deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssh_gcrypt_4:libssh_gcrypt_4:0.10.6-0\\+deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssh-gcrypt:libssh-gcrypt-4:0.10.6-0\\+deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssh-gcrypt:libssh_gcrypt_4:0.10.6-0\\+deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssh_gcrypt:libssh-gcrypt-4:0.10.6-0\\+deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssh_gcrypt:libssh_gcrypt_4:0.10.6-0\\+deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssh:libssh-gcrypt-4:0.10.6-0\\+deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssh:libssh_gcrypt_4:0.10.6-0\\+deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libssh-gcrypt-4@0.10.6-0%2Bdeb12u1?arch=amd64&distro=debian-12&upstream=libssh","upstreams":[{"name":"libssh"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2018-6829","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6829","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Negligible","urls":[],"description":"cipher/elgamal.c in Libgcrypt through 1.8.2, when used to encrypt messages directly, improperly encodes plaintexts, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading ciphertext data (i.e., it does not have semantic security in face of a ciphertext-only attack).

There is a variable \"dbentry->n_key_data\" in kadmin/dbutil/dump.c that can store 16-bit data but unknowingly the developer has assigned a \"u4\" variable to it, which is for 32-bit data. An attacker can use this vulnerability to affect other artifacts of the database as we know that a Kerberos database dump file contains trusted data.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2018-5709","epss":0.00463,"percentile":0.63387,"date":"2025-11-04"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"package":{"name":"krb5","version":"1.20.1-2+deb12u4"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2018-5709","versionConstraint":"none
