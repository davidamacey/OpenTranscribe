We're releasing OpenTranscribe v0.2.1, a security patch that addresses critical vulnerabilities identified in our container images. **All users are encouraged to update.**

## Why This Update Matters

As part of our commitment to security, we regularly scan our Docker images using industry-standard tools (Trivy, Grype). Our latest scans identified **4 critical CVEs** in the base images that required immediate attention.

## What's Fixed

### Critical Vulnerabilities Resolved (4 → 0)

| CVE | Package | Severity | Status |
|-----|---------|----------|--------|
| CVE-2025-47917 | libmbedcrypto | CRITICAL | Fixed |
| CVE-2023-6879 | libaom3 | CRITICAL | Fixed |
| CVE-2025-7458 | libsqlite3 | CRITICAL | Fixed |
| CVE-2023-45853 | zlib | CRITICAL | Fixed |

### Container Updates

**Frontend:**
- Upgraded from `nginx:1.29.3-alpine3.22` to `nginx:1.29.4-alpine3.23`
- Fixed 6 vulnerabilities (3 HIGH, 3 MEDIUM) in libpng and busybox
- Added HEALTHCHECK for better container orchestration

**Backend:**
- Upgraded from `python:3.12-slim-bookworm` to `python:3.13-slim-trixie`
- Moved from Debian 12 to Debian 13 "trixie" (released August 2025)

## How to Update

### Docker Compose Users

```bash
# Pull latest images
docker compose pull

# Restart services
docker compose up -d
```

### Manual Docker Users

```bash
docker pull davidamacey/opentranscribe-frontend:v0.2.1
docker pull davidamacey/opentranscribe-backend:v0.2.1
```

## Known Remaining Issues

Some vulnerabilities remain unfixable as they have no upstream patches available:

- **Frontend**: 3 tiff CVEs (no Alpine fix available)
- **Backend**: FFmpeg CVE-2025-9951 (no Debian fix, low risk - only used for audio extraction)

These are tracked and will be addressed when upstream fixes become available.

## Our Security Commitment

OpenTranscribe takes security seriously. We:

- Run automated security scans on every build
- Monitor CVE databases for new vulnerabilities
- Release patches promptly when critical issues are identified
- Document all security-related changes transparently
