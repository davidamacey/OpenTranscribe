## What Was Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Best Practices Guide ✅

**File:** `PROMPT_ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md`

A detailed markdown guide covering:
- Core principles (clarity, directness, XML structure)
- Few-shot prompting techniques with examples
- Chain-of-thought reasoning
- System prompt best practices
- Long context management strategies
- Structured output reliability
- Temperature settings recommendations
- Application-specific patterns for summarization and speaker ID

**Key Sections:**
- Quick reference for priority improvements
- Concrete examples for each technique
- Trade-off analysis for different approaches
- Testing and evaluation frameworks

---

### 2. LLM Service Enhancements ✅

**File:** `backend/app/services/llm_service.py`

#### A. Response Prefilling for JSON Output

**What:** Forces Claude to start responses with `{` character, bypassing preambles.

**Impact:**
- More reliable JSON parsing
- Fewer "Here's the summary..." preambles
- Reduced parsing errors

**Implementation:**
```python
# Added prefill_json parameter to _prepare_payload
if kwargs.get("prefill_json", False):
    if user_messages and user_messages[-1]["role"] == "user":
        user_messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": "{"})
```

**Applied to:**
- Single chunk summarization (line 479)
- Multi-chunk section processing (line 535)
- Final combined summaries (line 576)

#### B. Enhanced JSON Parsing

**What:** Handles prefilled responses and malformed JSON gracefully.

**Implementation:**
```python
# Handle response prefilling in _parse_summary_response
if not content.startswith("{") and not content.startswith("```"):
    content = "{" + content
```

**Impact:**
- More robust parsing
- Better error recovery
- Consistent output structure

#### C. Quote Extraction for Speaker Identification

**What:** Implements Anthropic's recommendation to request quotes first (improves recall from 27% → 98%).

**Implementation:**
```python
# Prefill speaker ID responses to force quote extraction
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Let me identify the most relevant evidence for each speaker:\n\nRELEVANT QUOTES AND EVIDENCE:\n"}
```

**Applied to:**
- `identify_speakers` method (line 856)

**Impact:**
- More accurate speaker identification
- Better evidence grounding
- Improved confidence scoring

#### D. Enhanced Speaker ID Parsing

**What:** Extracts JSON from responses that include prefilled quote sections.

**Implementation:**
```python
# Find JSON object after quote section
json_start = content.find("{")
if json_start > 0:
    content = content[json_start:]
```

**Impact:**
- Handles quote extraction responses correctly
- More reliable JSON parsing for speaker IDs

---

### 3. Enhanced System Prompts ✅

**File:** `database/prompt_improvements.sql`

#### Key Improvements:

**A. XML Structure**

Organized prompts with clear XML tags:
- `<task_instructions>` - What Claude should do
- `<transcript>` - The content to analyze
- `<speaker_information>` - Context about speakers
- `<output_format>` - Expected JSON structure
- `<examples>` - Few-shot examples
- `<analysis_guidelines>` - Detailed how-to

**Benefits:**
- Prevents section confusion
- Improves parsing accuracy
- Makes prompts more maintainable

**B. Few-Shot Examples**

Added 2 comprehensive examples:

1. **Business Meeting Example**
   - Shows BLUF format for decisions
   - Action items with owners and deadlines
   - Key decisions with context
   - Speaker analysis with roles

2. **Podcast Interview Example**
   - Shows BLUF format for insights
   - Different content type handling
   - Educational/informational focus
   - Expert opinion extraction

**Impact:**
- Dramatically improves output consistency
- Shows exactly what's expected
- Covers different content types

**C. Explicit BLUF Guidelines**

Clear requirements:
```
BLUF FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- First sentence: What happened / what was decided
- Second sentence: Why it matters / what's the impact
- Optional third: Next critical action
- 2-3 sentences maximum
- Must be understandable without reading rest
```

**Good vs Bad Examples:**
```
✅ "Q4 budget requires $50K reduction; team agreed to defer two feature releases..."
❌ "This meeting discussed various topics including budget..." (too vague)
```

**D. Enhanced Action Item Structure**

More detailed schema with context:
```json
{
  "item": "Verb-first specific task",
  "owner": "Full name",
  "due_date": "Specific or relative",
  "priority": "high|medium|low",
  "context": "Why this is needed",
  "mentioned_timestamp": "[MM:SS]"
}
```

**E. Content Type Adaptation**

Explicit instructions for different content types:
- Business Meetings → Decisions, actions, responsibilities
- Interviews → Insights, expertise, revelations
- Podcasts → Themes, expert opinions
- Documentaries → Facts, education, learnings

## Testing Checklist

### Summarization Tests

- [ ] Upload short meeting transcript (5-10 min)
- [ ] Verify BLUF follows 2-3 sentence format
- [ ] Check action items have owners and deadlines
- [ ] Confirm JSON parses correctly
- [ ] Review major topics structure

### Speaker Identification Tests

- [ ] Upload transcript with known speakers
- [ ] Check confidence scores are reasonable
- [ ] Verify evidence/reasoning is provided
- [ ] Confirm quote extraction in response
- [ ] Test with ambiguous speakers

### Edge Cases

- [ ] Very long transcript (>1 hour, multi-chunk)
- [ ] Short transcript (<2 minutes)
- [ ] No action items (casual conversation)
- [ ] Multiple content types (mixed meeting/discussion)
- [ ] Non-English content (if applicable)

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **JSON Parsing Success Rate**
   - Target: >95%
   - Monitor: Backend logs for parsing errors

2. **Response Quality**
   - BLUF clarity (manual review sample)
   - Action item completeness
   - Decision capture accuracy

3. **Performance**
   - Response time (should not increase significantly)
   - Token usage (may increase due to examples, but improves quality)
   - API costs (track monthly)

4. **Speaker Identification**
   - Confidence score distribution
   - Manual verification accuracy
   - False positive rate

### Log Monitoring

Watch for:
```bash
# Parsing errors
grep "Failed to parse" backend/logs/*.log

# JSON decode errors
grep "JSONDecodeError" backend/logs/*.log

# Speaker ID issues
grep "speaker_predictions" backend/logs/*.log
```

## Future Enhancements

### Priority 2 (Planned)

1. **Context Overlap in Chunking**
   - Add previous chunk summary to next chunk
   - Maintain continuity across sections
   - File: `llm_service.py` `_chunk_transcript_intelligently`

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Retry logic for malformed JSON
   - Schema validation with Pydantic
   - Graceful degradation

### Priority 3 (Future)

1. **Tool-Based Structured Output**
   - Use Claude's tool calling feature
   - Guaranteed schema compliance
   - Requires API changes

2. **Self-Correction Chain**
   - Claude reviews own summaries
   - "High-stakes" mode for important meetings
   - Increases latency but improves quality

3. **Prompt A/B Testing Framework**
   - Test prompt variations
   - Measure quality metrics
   - Data-driven improvements

---

## Rollback Procedure

If issues arise:

1. **Revert Database Prompts:**
   ```sql
   -- Restore from backup
   pg_restore -h localhost -U transcribe_user -d transcribe_db /path/to/backup.sql
   ```

2. **Revert Code Changes:**
   ```bash
   git diff HEAD~1 backend/app/services/llm_service.py
   git checkout HEAD~1 backend/app/services/llm_service.py
   ```

3. **Restart Services:**
   ```bash
   ./opentr.sh restart-backend
   ```
