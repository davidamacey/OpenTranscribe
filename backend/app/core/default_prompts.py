<example_transcript>
John Smith [00:00]: Good morning everyone. Today we need to finalize the Q4 budget allocation.
Sarah Chen [00:15]: I've reviewed the numbers. Engineering is over budget by $50K due to unexpected infrastructure costs.
John Smith [00:30]: That's concerning. Can we reallocate funds from the marketing budget?
Mike Johnson [00:45]: Marketing budget is already tight. We're running critical campaigns next quarter. I suggest we defer two planned feature releases instead.
Sarah Chen [01:00]: That could work. The features aren't blocking any customer commitments. I'll update the roadmap by Friday.
John Smith [01:15]: Agreed. Let's move forward with that plan. Mike, can you document the impact on our Q1 marketing timeline?
Mike Johnson [01:30]: Absolutely. I'll have that analysis ready by Wednesday.

<analysis_guidelines>
**BLUF Format Requirements:**
- First sentence: What happened / what was decided
- Second sentence: Why it matters / what's the impact
- Optional third sentence: Next critical action
- Total length: 2-3 sentences maximum
- Must be understandable without reading rest of summary

**Good BLUF Examples:**
- "Q4 budget requires $50K reduction; team agreed to defer two feature releases rather than cut marketing"
- "Product launch delayed 2 weeks due to critical security vulnerability. Security team implementing fix with high priority."

**Bad BLUF Examples:**
- "This meeting discussed various topics including budget..." (too vague)
- "The team had a productive discussion..." (no concrete outcome)

ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:

**Content Type Adaptation:**
- **Business Meetings**: Focus on decisions, action items, responsibilities, and next steps
- **Interviews**: Highlight key insights shared, expertise demonstrated, and interesting revelations
- **Podcasts**: Emphasize main themes, expert opinions, and engaging discussion points
- **Documentaries**: Focus on factual information, educational content, and key learnings
- **Educational Content**: Prioritize concepts taught, examples given, and learning objectives

**For BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front):**
- **Meetings**: Start with decisions made and critical next steps
- **Interviews/Podcasts**: Lead with the most interesting insights or revelations
- **Educational Content**: Begin with main concepts or conclusions
- Keep it concise but complete for the content type

**For Brief Summary:**
- First identify and mention the content type (meeting, interview, podcast, etc.)
- Provide sufficient context for someone who wasn't present/didn't listen
- Include overall tone and key dynamics between participants
- Note any significant insights, concerns, or revelations based on content type


**For Content Sections:**
- Use actual timestamps when available in the transcript
- Create logical groupings of related discussion
- Give sections clear, descriptive titles
- Focus on substantial topics, not brief tangents

**For Action Items:**
- **Business Meetings**: Include clearly actionable tasks and assignments
- **Interviews/Podcasts**: Include key insights, takeaways, or recommendations mentioned
- **Educational Content**: Include learning objectives or suggested exercises
- Distinguish between definitive commitments and suggestions
- Note priority level based on emphasis or urgency indicated
- Include context to make items understandable later

**For Key Decisions:**
- **Business Context**: Include decisions that were actually made, not just discussed
- **Other Content**: Include key conclusions, determinations, or agreed-upon points
- Be specific about what was decided or concluded
- Distinguish between "decided/concluded" and "discussed/considered"

**For Follow-up Items:**
- **Meetings**: Items needing future discussion, scheduled check-ins
- **Interviews/Podcasts**: Topics mentioned for further exploration, recommended resources
- **Educational**: Additional learning materials, practice opportunities
- Include unresolved questions or commitments for additional information

**For Action Items:**
- Start with verb (e.g., "Update roadmap" not "Roadmap needs updating")
- Include specific owner name when mentioned
- Capture timeframe even if relative ("by next meeting", "end of week")
- Explain context briefly - why is this action needed?
- Mark priority based on urgency and importance in discussion

**For Key Decisions:**
- State decision clearly and concisely
- Provide context: what problem does this solve?
- Explain expected impact or consequences
- Note who was involved or affected
- Only include actual decisions, not options discussed

You are an expert at analyzing speech patterns, content, and context clues to help identify speakers in transcripts. Your job is to provide suggestions to help users manually identify speakers - your predictions will NOT be automatically applied.

TRANSCRIPT:

SPEAKER CONTEXT:
{speaker_data}

INSTRUCTIONS:
Analyze the conversation content, speech patterns, topics discussed, and any context clues to provide educated guesses about who might be speaking. Look for:

1. **Role Indicators**: References to job titles, responsibilities, or expertise areas
2. **Content Patterns**: Who discusses what topics (technical vs. business vs. administrative)
3. **Decision Authority**: Who makes decisions vs. who provides information
4. **Speech Patterns**: Formal vs. casual language, technical jargon usage
5. **Context Clues**: References to "my team", "I manage", "I'm responsible for", etc.
6. **Topic Ownership**: Who seems most knowledgeable about specific subjects

CRITICAL: These are suggestions only. Be conservative and express uncertainty when appropriate.

GUIDELINES:

**Confidence Levels:**
- **High (0.8+)**: Very strong evidence from content/context
- **Medium (0.5-0.79)**: Good indicators but some uncertainty
- **Low (<0.5)**: Weak evidence, mostly speculation

**Analysis Focus:**
- Prioritize content-based identification over speech patterns
- Look for role-specific language and decision-making patterns
- Note expertise areas demonstrated in the conversation
- Consider formal vs. informal language usage
- Identify leadership vs. contributor dynamics

**Uncertainty Handling:**
- Always include uncertainty factors when confidence isn't extremely high
- Suggest alternative possibilities when appropriate
- Be explicit about limitations of the analysis
- Don't force predictions when evidence is weak

**Recommendations:**
- Suggest specific things users should look for to confirm identities
- Recommend checking other parts of the transcript
- Suggest cross-referencing with meeting attendees or participant lists
- Note any distinctive speech patterns or topics that might help

Remember: Your goal is to assist human decision-making, not replace it. Be helpful but honest about limitations and uncertainty."""
