# NGINX Reverse Proxy Setup for OpenTranscribe

This guide explains how to set up NGINX with SSL/TLS for OpenTranscribe, enabling:

- **Browser microphone recording** (required for HTTPS - browsers block mic access over HTTP)
- **Secure access from any device on your network**
- **Production deployments with custom domains**

## Why HTTPS is Required

Modern browsers enforce strict security policies. The `getUserMedia()` API (used for microphone access) only works in:

1. `localhost` connections (development exception)
2. HTTPS connections (production requirement)

If you try to use microphone recording over HTTP from another device or IP address, browsers will block it. This is documented in [GitHub Issue #72](https://github.com/davidamacey/OpenTranscribe/issues/72).

## Quick Start (Homelab/Local Network)

For homelabs and small businesses, self-signed certificates are the fastest way to get HTTPS working.

### Step 1: Generate SSL Certificates

```bash
# Navigate to OpenTranscribe directory
cd /path/to/OpenTranscribe

# Generate certificates with auto-detected IP addresses
./scripts/generate-ssl-cert.sh opentranscribe.local --auto-ip

# Or specify IP addresses manually
./scripts/generate-ssl-cert.sh opentranscribe.local --ip 192.168.1.100 --ip 10.0.0.50
```

This creates:
- `nginx/ssl/server.crt` - SSL certificate
- `nginx/ssl/server.key` - Private key

### Step 2: Configure Environment

Edit your `.env` file and add/uncomment:

```bash
NGINX_SERVER_NAME=opentranscribe.local
```

### Step 3: Configure DNS (Choose One)

**Option A: Router DNS (Recommended)**

Add a DNS entry in your router pointing `opentranscribe.local` to your server's IP address.

**Option B: Local Hosts File**

On each client device, add to `/etc/hosts` (Linux/Mac) or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` (Windows):

```
192.168.1.100  opentranscribe.local
```

Replace `192.168.1.100` with your server's actual IP address.

**Multi-Service Homelab Setup**

If you run multiple services on the same server, you can add multiple hostnames pointing to the same IP:

```
192.168.1.100  opentranscribe.local
192.168.1.100  nextcloud.local
192.168.1.100  jellyfin.local
192.168.1.100  homeassistant.local
```

Each service's NGINX/reverse proxy uses the `Host` header to route traffic correctly. This is a standard homelab configuration that works reliably.

**Pi-hole / AdGuard Home / Local DNS Server**

If you use a local DNS server (Pi-hole, AdGuard Home, Unbound, etc.), add an A record:
- **Domain**: `opentranscribe.local`
- **IP Address**: Your server's IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)

### Step 4: Start OpenTranscribe

```bash
./opentr.sh start dev
```

The script automatically detects `NGINX_SERVER_NAME` and includes the NGINX overlay.

### Step 5: Trust the Certificate

On each device that will access OpenTranscribe, you need to trust the self-signed certificate.

#### Windows

1. Copy `nginx/ssl/server.crt` to the client device
2. Double-click the `.crt` file
3. Click **Install Certificate** → **Local Machine**
4. Select **Place all certificates in the following store**
5. Browse and select **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**
6. Complete the wizard and restart your browser

#### macOS

1. Copy `nginx/ssl/server.crt` to the Mac
2. Double-click to open in Keychain Access
3. Find the certificate in the list, double-click it
4. Expand **Trust** section
5. Set **When using this certificate** to **Always Trust**
6. Close the window and enter your password to confirm

#### Linux (Chrome/Chromium)

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://settings/certificates`
2. Click **Authorities** tab → **Import**
3. Select `nginx/ssl/server.crt`
4. Check **Trust this certificate for identifying websites**
5. Click OK and restart Chrome

#### Linux (Firefox)

1. Open Firefox and go to `about:preferences#privacy`
2. Scroll to **Certificates** → **View Certificates**
3. Click **Authorities** tab → **Import**
4. Select `nginx/ssl/server.crt`
5. Check **Trust this CA to identify websites**
6. Click OK and restart Firefox

#### iOS

1. Email or AirDrop `server.crt` to your iOS device
2. Open the file → "Profile Downloaded" notification appears
3. Go to **Settings** → **General** → **VPN & Device Management**
4. Tap the downloaded profile and install it
5. Go to **Settings** → **General** → **About** → **Certificate Trust Settings**
6. Enable full trust for the OpenTranscribe certificate

#### Android

1. Copy `server.crt` to your Android device
2. Go to **Settings** → **Security** → **Encryption & credentials**
3. Tap **Install a certificate** → **CA certificate**
4. Select the `.crt` file and confirm installation

### Step 6: Access OpenTranscribe

Open your browser and go to:

```
https://opentranscribe.local
```

You can now use microphone recording from any device on your network!

## Production Setup (Let's Encrypt)

For production deployments with a public domain, use Let's Encrypt for free, trusted certificates.

### Prerequisites

- A domain name pointing to your server (e.g., `transcribe.example.com`)
- Ports 80 and 443 accessible from the internet

### Step 1: Install Certbot

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install certbot

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo dnf install certbot

# macOS
brew install certbot
```

### Step 2: Generate Certificates

Stop OpenTranscribe if running:

```bash
./opentr.sh stop
```

Generate certificates (standalone mode):

```bash
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d transcribe.example.com
```

Or with DNS validation (if ports 80/443 aren't available):

```bash
sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns -d transcribe.example.com
```

### Step 3: Link Certificates

```bash
# Create nginx/ssl directory
mkdir -p nginx/ssl

# Link Let's Encrypt certificates
sudo ln -sf /etc/letsencrypt/live/transcribe.example.com/fullchain.pem nginx/ssl/server.crt
sudo ln -sf /etc/letsencrypt/live/transcribe.example.com/privkey.pem nginx/ssl/server.key

# Fix permissions for Docker
sudo chmod 644 /etc/letsencrypt/live/transcribe.example.com/fullchain.pem
sudo chmod 600 /etc/letsencrypt/live/transcribe.example.com/privkey.pem
```

### Step 4: Configure Environment

Edit `.env`:

```bash
NGINX_SERVER_NAME=transcribe.example.com
NGINX_CERT_FILE=/etc/letsencrypt/live/transcribe.example.com/fullchain.pem
NGINX_CERT_KEY=/etc/letsencrypt/live/transcribe.example.com/privkey.pem
```

### Step 5: Set Up Auto-Renewal

```bash
# Test renewal
sudo certbot renew --dry-run

# Add to crontab for automatic renewal
echo "0 0 1 * * certbot renew --quiet && docker compose restart nginx" | sudo tee -a /etc/crontab
```

### Step 6: Start OpenTranscribe

```bash
./opentr.sh start prod
```

## Troubleshooting

### "SSL certificates not found" Error

The script checks for certificates before starting. Generate them first:

```bash
./scripts/generate-ssl-cert.sh your-hostname.local --auto-ip
```

### Browser Shows Security Warning

This is expected with self-signed certificates. You have two options:

1. **Trust the certificate** on each device (recommended for homelab)
2. **Use Let's Encrypt** for publicly trusted certificates (recommended for production)

### "Connection Refused" on Port 443

Check if NGINX container is running:

```bash
docker compose ps nginx
docker compose logs nginx
```

### Microphone Still Not Working

1. Verify you're using HTTPS (not HTTP)
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Ensure the certificate is trusted on the device
4. Try in an incognito/private window

### Certificate Expired

For self-signed certificates:
```bash
./scripts/generate-ssl-cert.sh your-hostname.local --auto-ip
./opentr.sh restart-all
```

For Let's Encrypt:
```bash
sudo certbot renew
docker compose restart nginx
```

## Advanced: Custom NGINX Configuration

To customize the NGINX configuration:

1. Edit `nginx/site.conf.template`
2. Restart NGINX: `docker compose restart nginx`

Common customizations:

- Add HTTP Basic Authentication for Flower/MinIO
- Adjust client body size limits
- Add custom headers
- Configure rate limiting

Example: Adding Basic Auth for Flower

```nginx
location /flower/ {
    proxy_pass http://flower:5555/flower/;
    auth_basic "Flower Dashboard";
    auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Self-Signed Certificates

- **Suitable for**: Homelab, internal networks, development
- **Not suitable for**: Public-facing production deployments
- **Warning**: Users will see browser security warnings until they trust the certificate

### Let's Encrypt Certificates

- **Suitable for**: Production deployments with public domains
- **Benefits**: Free, automatically trusted by all browsers
- **Requirement**: Domain must be publicly accessible for validation

### Certificate Best Practices

1. Keep private keys secure (never commit to git)
2. Use strong key sizes (2048-bit minimum, 4096-bit recommended)
3. Renew certificates before expiration
4. Monitor certificate expiration dates
