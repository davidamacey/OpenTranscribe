This condition may result in heap corruption or application instability in low-memory scenarios, posing a risk to system reliability where key export operations are performed.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-5351","epss":0.00024,"percentile":0.05698,"date":"2025-12-11"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"package":{"name":"libssh","version":"0.10.6-0+deb12u1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-5351","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"f2a719b78263a00d","name":"libssh-gcrypt-4","version":"0.10.6-0+deb12u1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:533340a54f95bf8182428f20a868836cee84970fca4490efa67b28f92eaab6d6","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libssh-gcrypt-4/copyright","layerID":"sha256:533340a54f95bf8182428f20a868836cee84970fca4490efa67b28f92eaab6d6","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libssh-gcrypt-4/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libssh-gcrypt-4:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:533340a54f95bf8182428f20a868836cee84970fca4490efa67b28f92eaab6d6","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libssh-gcrypt-4:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-clause","BSD-3-clause","LGPL-2.1","LGPL-2.1+~OpenSSL","public-domain"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libssh-gcrypt-4:libssh-gcrypt-4:0.10.6-0\\+deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssh-gcrypt-4:libssh_gcrypt_4:0.10.6-0\\+deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssh_gcrypt_4:libssh-gcrypt-4:0.10.6-0\\+deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssh_gcrypt_4:libssh_gcrypt_4:0.10.6-0\\+deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssh-gcrypt:libssh-gcrypt-4:0.10.6-0\\+deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssh-gcrypt:libssh_gcrypt_4:0.10.6-0\\+deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssh_gcrypt:libssh-gcrypt-4:0.10.6-0\\+deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssh_gcrypt:libssh_gcrypt_4:0.10.6-0\\+deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssh:libssh-gcrypt-4:0.10.6-0\\+deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssh:libssh_gcrypt_4:0.10.6-0\\+deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libssh-gcrypt-4@0.10.6-0%2Bdeb12u1?arch=amd64&distro=debian-12&upstream=libssh","upstreams":[{"name":"libssh"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2021-45346","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-45346","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Negligible","urls":[],"description":"A Memory Leak vulnerability exists in SQLite Project SQLite3 3.35.1 and 3.37.0 via maliciously crafted SQL Queries (made via editing the Database File), it is possible to query a record, and leak subsequent bytes of memory that extend beyond the record, which could let a malicious user obtain sensitive information.

The timing signal is so small that it is infeasible to be detected without having the attacking process running on the same physical system.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-27587","epss":0.00035,"percentile":0.10077,"date":"2025-12-11"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"3.0.17-1~deb12u3"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-27587","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"630488fdcf809ce9","name":"openssl","version":"3.0.17-1~deb12u3","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:533340a54f95bf8182428f20a868836cee84970fca4490efa67b28f92eaab6d6","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","layerID":"sha256:9bb1d272ab0d3d1df8839cd5bf08c58b807bf38ac61d77dfe50e7da84afc21b3","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:9bb1d272ab0d3d1df8839cd5bf08c58b807bf38ac61d77dfe50e7da84afc21b3","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:9bb1d272ab0d3d1df8839cd5bf08c58b807bf38ac61d77dfe50e7da84afc21b3","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list","layerID":"sha256:9bb1d272ab0d3d1df8839cd5bf08c58b807bf38ac61d77dfe50e7da84afc21b3","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst","layerID":"sha256:9bb1d272ab0d3d1df8839cd5bf08c58b807bf38ac61d77dfe50e7da84afc21b3","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst"}],"language":"","licenses":["Apache-2.0","Artistic","GPL-1","GPL-1+"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:3.0.17-1\\~deb12u3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/openssl@3.0.17-1~deb12u3?arch=amd64&distro=debian-12","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-8961","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-8961","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Negligible","urls":[],"description":"A weakness has been identified in LibTIFF 4.7.0.
