# FIPS 140-3 Cryptographic Compliance Guide

This document describes OpenTranscribe's compliance with FIPS 140-3 cryptographic standards for federal government and high-security deployments.

## Overview

FIPS 140-3 (Federal Information Processing Standard) is the latest cryptographic module validation standard, mandatory for new federal system deployments since September 2021. OpenTranscribe supports FIPS 140-3 compliant cryptographic operations for:

- Password hashing (PBKDF2-SHA256)
- Data encryption (AES-256-GCM)
- JWT signing (HS512)
- Token hashing (SHA-512)
- MFA backup codes (PBKDF2-SHA256)

## Configuration

### Enabling FIPS 140-3 Mode

Set the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Enable FIPS 140-3 compliance
FIPS_VERSION=140-3

# Password hashing iterations (NIST SP 800-132 2024 recommendation)
PBKDF2_ITERATIONS_V3=600000

# JWT signing algorithm
JWT_ALGORITHM_V3=HS512

# Encryption algorithm
ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM_V3=AES-256-GCM

# Migration mode (compatible = accept both old and new, strict = new only)
FIPS_MIGRATION_MODE=compatible

# Entropy validation
FIPS_VALIDATE_ENTROPY=true
```

### Algorithm Comparison

| Component | FIPS 140-2 | FIPS 140-3 | Migration |
|-----------|------------|------------|-----------|
| Password Hashing | PBKDF2-SHA256 (210k iter) | PBKDF2-SHA256 (600k iter) | Auto-upgrade on login |
| Symmetric Encryption | Fernet (AES-128-CBC) | AES-256-GCM | Auto-upgrade on access |
| JWT Signing | HS256 | HS512 | Dual verification |
| Token Hashing | SHA-256 | SHA-512 | Auto-upgrade on issuance |
| MFA Backup Codes | bcrypt | PBKDF2-SHA256 (600k iter) | Regenerate required |

## Password Hashing

### PBKDF2-SHA256 with 600,000 Iterations

OpenTranscribe uses PBKDF2-SHA256 with 600,000 iterations for password hashing, meeting the NIST SP 800-132 (2024) recommendations.

**Why 600,000 iterations?**
- OWASP 2023 recommends minimum 600,000 for PBKDF2-SHA256
- Provides ~0.5 second verification time on modern hardware
- Balances security with user experience

**Automatic Upgrade:**
When a user with a legacy hash (bcrypt or lower iteration PBKDF2) logs in:
1. Password is verified against existing hash
2. If valid, password is re-hashed with current algorithm
3. New hash is stored in database
4. User experiences no disruption

### Verification

```python
from app.core.security import verify_password, get_password_hash

# Hash verification
is_valid = verify_password(plain_password, hashed_password)

# New hash creation
new_hash = get_password_hash(password)
# Returns: $pbkdf2-sha256$600000$...
```

## Data Encryption

### AES-256-GCM

Sensitive data (API keys, TOTP secrets) is encrypted using AES-256-GCM with:
- 256-bit key derived via PBKDF2-SHA256
- 96-bit random nonce per encryption
- 128-bit authentication tag

**Data Format:**
```
v3:base64(salt):base64(nonce):base64(ciphertext+tag)
```

**Key Derivation:**
```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2 import PBKDF2HMAC
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes

kdf = PBKDF2HMAC(
    algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
    length=32,  # 256 bits
    salt=salt,
    iterations=600000
)
key = kdf.derive(password)
```

**Backward Compatibility:**
Data without the `v3:` prefix is assumed to be legacy Fernet-encrypted and will be:
1. Decrypted using Fernet
2. Re-encrypted using AES-256-GCM
3. Stored with `v3:` prefix

## JWT Signing

### HS512 Algorithm

JWTs are signed using HMAC-SHA512 (HS512) for FIPS 140-3 compliance.

**Token Structure:**
```json
{
  "sub": "user-uuid",
  "exp": 1234567890,
  "iat": 1234567800,
  "jti": "unique-token-id",
  "type": "access",
  "role": "admin"
}
```

**Dual Verification:**
During migration, tokens are verified with algorithm fallback:
1. Try HS512 first (FIPS 140-3)
2. Fall back to HS256 (legacy)

This ensures existing sessions continue to work during upgrade.

## MFA Compliance

### TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password)

TOTP uses SHA-1 by default per RFC 6238. This is FIPS-allowed because:
- NIST SP 800-131A Rev. 2 permits SHA-1 for HMAC-based applications
- SHA-1's collision weakness doesn't affect HMAC security
- Ensures compatibility with Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, etc.

**Optional SHA-256/SHA-512:**
For high-security environments with compatible apps:
```bash
TOTP_ALGORITHM=SHA256  # or SHA512
```

### Backup Codes

Backup codes are hashed using PBKDF2-SHA256 with 600,000 iterations:
- 8-character alphanumeric codes (XXXX-XXXX format)
- Cryptographically generated using `secrets` module
- One-time use with secure deletion after verification

## Migration Guide

### Pre-Migration Checklist

1. Backup database
2. Note current FIPS_MODE setting
3. Review number of active users
4. Schedule maintenance window (if strict mode)

### Migration Steps

**Compatible Mode (Recommended):**
```bash
# Step 1: Enable FIPS 140-3 in compatible mode
FIPS_VERSION=140-3
FIPS_MIGRATION_MODE=compatible

# Step 2: Restart services
./opentr.sh restart-backend

# Step 3: Monitor migration progress
# Users will be upgraded on next login
```

**Monitoring Progress:**
- Check admin dashboard for migration status
- View percentage of users with upgraded hashes
- Review audit logs for upgrade events

### Rollback

If issues occur:
```bash
# Revert to FIPS 140-2
FIPS_VERSION=140-2
FIPS_MIGRATION_MODE=compatible

# Restart services
./opentr.sh restart-backend
```

All data remains accessible; the system simply stops creating new FIPS 140-3 artifacts.

## Compliance Verification

### Verification Script

Run the compliance verification script:
```bash
./scripts/verify-fips-140-3.sh
```

This checks:
- Password hashing algorithm and iterations
- JWT signing algorithm
- Encryption algorithm
- Token hash algorithm

### Audit Trail

All cryptographic operations are logged:
- Password hash upgrades
- Encryption algorithm changes
- Token re-issuance

Logs are available in:
- `/var/log/opentranscribe/audit.log`
- OpenSearch (if `AUDIT_LOG_TO_OPENSEARCH=true`)
