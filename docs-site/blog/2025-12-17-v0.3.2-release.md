# OpenTranscribe v0.3.2 Released

Patch release fixing critical bugs in the one-liner installation script that prevented successful setup on fresh installations.

<!-- truncate -->

## Overview

This is a **scripts-only release** - no Docker container rebuild required. Existing installations are unaffected as the containers already have the necessary fixes.

## Fixed

### Scripts Directory Creation

Fixed `curl` error 23 ("Failure writing output to destination") when downloading SSL and permission scripts during setup. The `scripts/` directory is now created before attempting downloads.

**Before:** Setup would fail with cryptic curl errors
**After:** All script downloads complete successfully

### PyTorch 2.6+ Compatibility

Applied the `torch.load` patch to `download-models.py` for PyTorch 2.6+ compatibility. This mirrors the fix already present in the backend (from Wes Brown's commit).

PyTorch 2.6 changed the default value of `weights_only` from `False` to `True`, which caused omegaconf deserialization errors when downloading PyAnnote speaker diarization models.

**Before:** Model downloads failed with "WeightsUnpickler error: Unsupported global: GLOBAL omegaconf.listconfig.ListConfig"
**After:** Models download successfully

## Upgrade Notes

### New Installations

The one-liner setup script now works correctly:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidamacey/OpenTranscribe/master/setup-opentranscribe.sh | bash
```

### Existing Installations

No action required - Docker containers already have the PyTorch fix in the backend.
