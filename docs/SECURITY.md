# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain and provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in OpenTranscribe, please follow these guidelines:

### Reporting Process

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security concerns to: [your-email@domain.com] (replace with your email)
3. Include as much detail as possible:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fixes (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Investigation**: We'll investigate and assess the vulnerability
- **Updates**: We'll provide regular updates on our progress
- **Resolution**: We'll work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible

### Response Timeline

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: 24-48 hours for initial response, 7 days for fix
- **High severity**: 72 hours for initial response, 14 days for fix
- **Medium/Low severity**: 1 week for initial response, 30 days for fix

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Docker Security
- Keep Docker and Docker Compose updated
- Use non-root users in containers when possible
- Regularly update base images
- Scan images for vulnerabilities

### API Security
- Use strong JWT secrets in production
- Enable HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- Regularly rotate API keys and secrets
- Implement rate limiting

### Data Security
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use secure file upload validation
- Regularly backup your data
- Monitor access logs

### Infrastructure Security
- Keep all dependencies updated
- Use firewalls to restrict access
- Monitor system logs
- Implement proper access controls

## Known Security Considerations

### File Uploads
- OpenTranscribe processes user-uploaded audio/video files
- Files are validated for type and size
- Consider running in isolated environments for maximum security

### AI Model Security
- WhisperX models are downloaded from Hugging Face
- Verify model checksums when possible
- Keep models updated

### Database Security
- Use strong database passwords
- Limit database access to necessary services only
- Regularly backup database with encryption

## Security Features (v0.4.0)

### Core Security
- JWT-based authentication with secure refresh token rotation
- Role-based access control (RBAC): `user`, `admin`, `super_admin`
- AES-256-GCM encrypted authentication configuration stored in database
- File type validation and input sanitization
- CORS protection
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Private MinIO buckets (no public object access)
- Non-root container user (`appuser`, UID 1000) following principle of least privilege
- Per-IP and per-user rate limiting on all auth and API endpoints

### Enterprise Authentication (4-Method Hybrid)

All four methods can be active simultaneously. Users choose their preferred login method on the login screen.

| Method | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Local** | bcrypt_sha256 password hashing | Default for standalone deployments |
| **LDAP/AD** | LDAPS with service account binding, username or email login | Enterprise Active Directory integration |
| **OIDC/Keycloak** | OAuth 2.0 with PKCE, OIDC discovery, federated logout | Single Sign-On, federated identity |
| **PKI/X.509** | mTLS client certificates, OCSP/CRL revocation | Government systems (CAC/PIV) |

Auth configuration is stored encrypted (AES-256-GCM) in the database and managed via the Super Admin UI. See detailed setup guides:
- [LDAP Authentication](LDAP_AUTH.md)
- [Keycloak/OIDC Setup](KEYCLOAK_SETUP.md)
- [PKI/Certificate Authentication](PKI_SETUP.md)
- [Auth Deployment Guide](AUTH_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- **TOTP**: RFC 6238 compliant time-based one-time passwords (HMAC-SHA1, 30-second window, 6 digits)
- **Authenticator app compatible**: Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Authy, FreeOTP, 1Password, etc.
- **Backup Codes**: Emergency recovery codes (stored hashed with PBKDF2-SHA256)
- **Configurable Enforcement**: Required for admins only, or for all users
- **External IdP bypass**: PKI and Keycloak users bypass local MFA (their IdP handles it)

### Password Security (FedRAMP IA-5 Compliant)

**Password Policies:**
- Minimum length (configurable, default 12 characters)
- Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
- Password history enforcement (prevents reuse of last N passwords)
- Expiration policies (configurable, optional)
- Common password and pattern blacklist

**Implementation:**
- bcrypt_sha256 hashing (overcomes bcrypt's 72-byte limit)
- PBKDF2-SHA256 available for FIPS mode (210,000 iterations FIPS 140-2; 600,000 iterations FIPS 140-3)
- Automatic hash algorithm upgrade on login
- Secure password reset with time-limited tokens

### Account Lockout (NIST AC-7 Compliant)

- Configurable failed attempt threshold (default: 5 attempts)
- Progressive lockout duration
- Automatic unlock after timeout
- Admin override capability (lock/unlock via Admin UI)
- Lockout events logged for security monitoring

### Certificate Revocation (PKI)

- **OCSP**: Real-time revocation checking — denied access within seconds of revocation
- **CRL**: Periodic revocation list — configurable refresh interval (default 24 hours)
- Both methods can be active simultaneously

### Session Management

- Short-lived JWT access tokens (configurable expiration, default 60 minutes)
- Refresh token rotation on every use (stolen tokens become invalid after single use)
- Concurrent session limits per user (configurable)
- Session invalidation on password change and admin-forced logout
- Idle timeout and absolute session timeout options

### Rate Limiting

Authentication endpoints are protected with rate limiting:
- Login attempts: Configurable per-IP and per-user limits
- Registration: Prevents mass account creation
- Password reset: Prevents enumeration attacks
- API endpoints: Configurable limits per endpoint

### Audit Logging

All authentication events are logged in structured **JSON** and **CEF (Common Event Format)** for SIEM integration:
- Login attempts (success/failure with method, IP, user agent)
- Password changes and MFA enrollment/removal
- Account lockouts and unlocks
- Session creation and termination
- Administrative actions (config changes, role promotions)
- Certificate validation events (PKI)

Logs are available in container stdout and optionally indexed in OpenSearch (set `AUDIT_LOG_TO_OPENSEARCH=true`).

## FedRAMP Compliance Features

- Authenticator feedback protection (no password hints)
- Password expiration policies with advance warning
- bcrypt_sha256 default; PBKDF2-SHA256 in FIPS mode

### SC-13: Cryptographic Protection
- AES-256-GCM for sensitive configuration data at rest
- TLS 1.2+ for all service-to-service communication
- PBKDF2-SHA256 for password-based key derivation (FIPS mode)

### AU-2/AU-3: Audit Events

- Timestamp and user identification on every event
- Event type and outcome (success/failure) recording
- Source IP address and user agent logging
